## Description

FOSSASIA is an organization developing Open Source software applications and Open Hardware together with a global community from its base in Asia. It is our goal to provide access to open technologies, science applications and knowledge that improve people's lives. We want to enable people to adapt and change technology according to their own ideas and needs and validate science and knowledge through an Open Access approach. FOSSASIA was established 2009 by Hong Phuc Dang and Mario Behling. We organize and participate in conferences, meetups and code camps. The annual FOSSASIA Summit is one of the top tech events in Asia. Other summits take place in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India. FOSSASIA also runs a number of coding programs such as Codeheat. Please join us and start contributing to our projects, participate as a coder, designer, hardware developer or event organizer.
