## Description

We democratize access to AI tools for drug discovery and other scientific applications of deep learning more broadly. We also maintain a collection of scientific datasets for benchmarking and building new deep learning architectures along with an extensive open source collection of scientific machine learning tutorials. DeepChem has a strong educational component and partners with a broad range of academic and governmental institutions.
