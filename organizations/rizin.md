## Description

The Rizin project is a fork of the famous Radare2 project that started in 2006. Since then the codebase has been rewritten multiple times, modularized and extended to support many new features. The Rizin project aims to provide stability, focus on the most important features, and provide a user friendly interface. Along with Cutter - a Qt-based GUI and the RzGhidra decompiler it makes the effective tool for everyday reversing tasks.

Rizin is composed of a hexadecimal editor at its core, with support for several architectures and binary formats. It features code analysis capabilities, scripting, data and code visualization through graphs and other means, a visual mode, easy UNIX integration, a binary diffing engine for code and data, a shellcode compiler, multi-platform debug with reverse debug capabilities and much, much more!
