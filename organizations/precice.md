## Description

preCICE is an open-source coupling library and ecosystem for general partitioned multi-physics and multi-scale simulations, including surface and volume coupling.

Partitioned means that preCICE couples existing programs/solvers capable of simulating a subpart of the complete physics involved in a simulation. This allows for the high flexibility that is needed to keep a decent time-to-solution for complex coupled problems.

The software offers convenient methods for transient equation coupling, communication, time interpolation, and data mapping.
