## Description

The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF; www.incf.org) is an international organization launched in 2005, following a proposal from the Global Science Forum of the OECD. 

INCF was established to facilitate and promote the sharing of data and computing resources in the international neuroscience community.  A larger objective of INCF is to help develop scalable, portable, and extensible applications that can be used by neuroscience laboratories worldwide. 

The mission of INCF is to make neuroscience FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) by sharing and integrating neuroscience data and knowledge worldwide. We foster scientific community collaboration to develop standards for data sharing, analysis  modeling and simulation in order to catalyze insights into brain function in health and disease.

INCF activities are open to all who can contribute to neuroinformatics at the international level. We have a global community of neuroscience researchers working on new and improved tools for all of neuroscience – enabling other researchers to make more and faster discoveries, and improving our understanding of the brain.
