## Description

MalariaGEN is a global network of global partners who share and integrate data relevant to inform malaria surveillance, our mission is to generate insights and tools that bridge the gaps for analysts in malaria endemic settings to use their data meaningfully to inform public health efforts. We build and optimise data resources and analytical tools to run directly in the cloud. Our flagship project is the Vector Observatory, which includes whole-genome sequence data for over 30,000 mosquitoes, integrating data from 70 partners across the globe from over 17 different mosquito species -- this is the largest resource on genetic variation data for any multicellular organism (other than humans!). Our goal is to enable analysts, scientists, students and public health practitioners to access these data without the need for any dedicated compute infrastructure, by optimising our resources to run within free compute environments (a big shout to Google Colab!) and by developing training resources that support partners to get confident with using cloud-native data and resources for their analysis.
