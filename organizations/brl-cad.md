## Description

<p>This is the place to be if you love computer graphics.  We do 2D/3D modeling, 3D printing, solid geometry, design, and more.  Depending on the project, you have the opportunity to work with C/C++, Python, OpenGL, OpenCL, Qt, Javascript, and more...  Help us develop open source computer-aided technologies (CAx)!</p>
<br>
<p>We operates as an umbrella organization with several CAx communities including:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li> - OpenSCAD is a solid 3D modeler with a rich syntax for programmable geometry.
<li> - LibreCAD is a 2D modeling system specializing in blueprint-style drawings and draftings.
<li> - IfcOpenShell is a library for working with standard IFC building model data.
<li> - BRL-CAD is a solid modeling suite with conversion and advanced solid ray tracing features.
<li> - Manifold is a solid geometry mesh processing library.
</ul>
<br>
<p>We want to select at least one student for each, so feel free to ask us where to start.</p>
