## Description

Machine Learning for Science (ML4SCI) is an umbrella organization for machine learning-related projects in science. ML4SCI brings together researchers from universities and scientific laboratories with motivated students to join existing scientific collaborations and contribute to cutting edge science projects across a wide variety of disciplines. Students work on existing problems to develop new machine learning-based approaches and produce open source code that directly contributes to solving these scientific challenges. 

ML4SCI currently includes projects from a variety of fields. For example, some of them explore the uses of machine learning for particle reconstruction and classification in high-energy physics, deep learning-based searches for dark matter in astrophysics, applications of machine learning techniques to data returned from planetary science missions, applications of quantum machine learning to science, and others.

Machine learning ideas and approaches can be broadly applicable and transferable across the scientific domains. The goals of ML4SCI projects are to grow the open-source community in machine learning for science by addressing important scientific challenges and transferring the knowledge and tools of machine learning across the disciplines. We look forward to your applications!
