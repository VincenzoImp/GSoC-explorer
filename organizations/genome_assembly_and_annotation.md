## Description

EMBL-EBI is a global centre for biological data, developing and maintaining open data resources and open-source software that support life science research worldwide. Our services are used daily by researchers across academia, healthcare, and industry, and span genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, molecular interactions, chemistry, and functional annotation.

EMBL-EBI develops and maintains a wide range of long-standing, high-impact resources, including Ensembl for genome data, the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) for sequence data, MGnify for metagenomics analysis, and BioStudies for structured biological datasets. Together, these resources support data submission, analysis, integration, and reuse at global scale.

Given the rapid growth and increasing complexity of biological data, EMBL-EBI operates a fast-evolving software ecosystem and continuously explores new approaches to data processing, storage, distribution, and visualisation. Our codebases are open source, our data are freely available, and we actively engage with the open-source community to ensure our infrastructure remains robust, scalable, and accessible.

Through Google Summer of Code, EMBL-EBI offers contributors the opportunity to work on real-world scientific software, gaining experience in open-source development while contributing to tools and resources used by the global life science community.
