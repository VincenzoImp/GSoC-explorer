## Description

Learning Equality is an education technology nonprofit focused on fostering  student-centered learning and advancing organizations working with underserved teachers and learners globally. Through community-driven innovation and strategic partnerships, we provide offline-first, open-source digital tools and implementation support to help them thrive.
We create and support open-source technology that directly and focally addresses the infrastructural and resource equity gaps that further marginalize learners with limited Internet. We started by enabling offline access to Khan Academy's videos and exercises and grew to become a key player in the global education technology landscape. For the past 13 years we’ve focused on boosting learning outcomes in some of the most challenging contexts, supporting disconnected learning in refugee camps, rural schools, out-of-school programs, and more.
Learning Equality develops and maintains Kolibri, an adaptable set of open tools specially designed to support teaching and learning with tech but without the Internet for the third of the world that still lacks access to connectivity.
Kolibri is centered around an offline-first learning platform that runs on a variety of low-cost and legacy devices. It is complemented by a curricular tool, a library of open educational materials, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation. These tools are open and available in a variety of languages to better support learners and educators globally.
As a community-driven nonprofit, Learning Equality works closely to co-design Kolibri with a core network of collaborators, including national NGOs, UN agencies, government, and corporate partners. We also adopt a needs-based approach, constantly gathering insights from our community to inform the development of our tools.
Through its do-it-yourself adoption model and strategic collaborations, Learning Equality has conservatively reached  13 million  learners and educators in every country in the world. Given our offline access and distribution model, we learn about usage of Kolibri through a combination of telemetry ping backs of high level, aggregate, anonymized statistics, data from partners, and use of our Kolibri Data Portal. Since instances of Kolibri never need to connect to the Internet to be used, we do not know about usage across every instance, which is why this is an informed estimate from years of data.
