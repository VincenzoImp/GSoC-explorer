## Description

The Honeynet Project is a leading international 501c3 non-profit security research organization, dedicated to investigating the latest attacks and developing open source security tools to improve Internet security. With Chapters around the world, our volunteers have contributed to fight against malware (such as Conficker), discovering new attacks and creating security tools used by businesses and government agencies all over the world.

The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.
