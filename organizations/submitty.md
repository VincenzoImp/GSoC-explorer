Submitty has been used at a half dozen other universities and we aim to grow to more users and developers.  The courses using Submitty cover the undergraduate and graduate curriculum from introductory programming courses, intermediate and advanced theory courses, popular junior/senior electives with team projects and written reports, and specialized graduate courses.

We regularly present our work at the annual ACM SIGCSE conference.
