## Description

Our goal is to streamline the process of scaling and deploying machine learning (ML) models to production by leveraging Kubernetes' strengths: 
<br /><br />
-   Seamless deployments: Effortless, repeatable, and portable deployments across diverse infrastructure, allowing you to experiment on local machines and then seamlessly transition to on-premises clusters or the cloud.
<br /><br />
-   Microservice management: Efficient deployment and management of loosely-coupled microservices for building modular and scalable ML pipelines.
<br /><br />
-   Dynamic scaling: Automated scaling based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
<br /><br />
User-centric design: Recognizing the diverse tool preferences within the ML community, we prioritize user customization (within reasonable boundaries). Our system takes care of the repetitive tasks, freeing users to focus on the core ML challenges.
<br /><br />
Starting focused, expanding rapidly: While we initially focused on specific technologies, we actively collaborate with various projects to integrate additional tools and broaden our reach.
<br /><br />
Our vision: A future where simple manifests empower you to utilize a user-friendly ML stack anywhere Kubernetes runs, with self-configuration capabilities based on the deployment environment.
