## Description

stdlib is a standard library for JavaScript and Node.js with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computing applications. The project aims to provide functionality similar to NumPy and SciPy for use in JavaScript environments with special consideration for the unique constraints and opportunities afforded by the Web. stdlib is primarily written in JavaScript, C, and Fortran.
