## Description

The National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB, https://nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open-source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery. Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. 
The NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), WikiPathways (https://wikipathways.org/), SBML (https://sbml.org/), SBGN (https://sbgn.github.io/) and others. This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing! For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over 24,000 times per month by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our 96% success rate (https://nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don’t take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students (https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and mentors (https://nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).
