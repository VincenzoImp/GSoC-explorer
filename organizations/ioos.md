## Description

U.S. IOOS is a national and regional partnership working to provide ocean, coastal and Great Lakes observations, data, tools, and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment.  Our primary purpose is to provide free and open data about the state of our oceans and Great Lakes to our users.  These data are fundamental to understanding the health of our marine ecosystems, to monitor the climate signal as captured in oceanographic conditions, and to provide predictions about the future state of our oceans and coasts.
