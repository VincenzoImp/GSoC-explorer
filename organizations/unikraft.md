## Description

Unikraft is a fast, secure and open-source Unikernel Development Kit.

By tailoring the operating system, libraries and configuration to the particular needs of your application, it vastly reduces virtual machine and container image sizes to a few KBs, provides blazing performance, and drastically cuts down your software stack’s attack surface.

Unikraft is developed in the spirit of open source: public discussions on Discord, open source licensing model using BSD-3-Clause, public development and management on GitHub.

It does so in the context of a vibrant community consisting of highly skilled software engineers, researchers, teachers, students and hobbyists. Periodic meetings, hackathons and a consistent presence in open source events are central to the well functioning of the community.

We use guidelines for development and maintenance to ensure the creation of high quality code.

Public releases are planned to happen once every two months. In general, we aim for a public release to happen at the last Monday of each odd month (January, March, May, etc.)

We welcome contributors and users on Discord and on GitHub. If you are looking for a fun technical project in the area of operating systems, virtualization, come aboard on Discord.
