## Description

CircuitVerse is an easy to use digital logic circuit simulator which aims at providing a platform to create, share and learn digital circuits. It can run on almost any device without the need for installing any software. The platform has been designed for use by students, professionals and hobbyists alike. The vision is to develop a community around the platform that will aid students to self-learn digital logic design. The platform is currently used by several universities worldwide. Apart from the simulator, users can create, learn, collaborate and share their work. Teachers can create groups and host assignments on the platform. The platform’s impact has been more evident than ever in the Covid 19 pandemic as CircuitVerse enabled schools and colleges to move their courses online.
