## Description

Accord Project champions the importance of contract text alongside computer-code when automating contracts. This is often referred to as Computable Contracts or Smart Legal Contracts.

The Accord Project is a non-profit, collaborative, initiative developing an ecosystem and open source tools for computational contracts. The community includes participants from law firms, technology companies, universities, government and private individuals.

Today, the community maintains a technology neutral foundation for smart legal contracts, based on the union of legal text with a machine readable data model, and machine executable logic. This definition of a smart legal contract is recognised across the industry, including by statutory and standards bodies. 

Accord Project is a top-level Linux Foundation project.
