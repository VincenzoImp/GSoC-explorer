## Description

Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that is easy to read and adheres to a coding standard. Our utility automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard. Each and every check also forces our users who are not familiar with these standards to read them and makes them think about why these standards exist.
