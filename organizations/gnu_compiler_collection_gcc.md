## Description

The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. It includes front-ends for C, C++, D, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go, as well as libraries for these languages (such as libgcc and libstdc++). Modula-2, Rust, Cobol, and Algol 68 front-ends are under development too.  GCC includes a Static Analyzer, and supports OpenMP, OpenACC with code offloading to Nvidia and AMD GPUs.
