## Description

KolibriOS is a tiny open-source graphical operating system for x86 (and compatible) architecture computers, developed and maintained by the KolibriOS Project Team. It contains a monolithic kernel that runs in 32-bit protected mode and supports full preemptive multitasking.

KolibriOS is a fork of MenuetOS, written almost entirely in FASM (assembly language). However, C, Sphinx C--, C++, Free Pascal, Forth, among other high-level languages and compilers, can also be used in user application development (although FASM is preferred).

The OS features a rich set of applications that include a word processor, image viewer, graphical editor, textual web browser, and over 30 games. Full FAT12/16/32 and EXT2/3/4 support is implemented, as well as read-only support for NTFS, ISO9660 and XFS. Drivers are written for popular sound, network and graphics cards.

KolibriOS is VERY light on system requirements, using as little as 1MB of disk space and 8MB RAM to run. In terms of processing power, Intel®'s original Pentium® (P5 microarchitecture) or compatible CPU is sufficient to fully enjoy KolibriOS. We strive to become the OS of choice for all older computers, and provide their owners full modern OS experience.
