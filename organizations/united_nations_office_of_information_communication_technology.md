## Description

The Open Source Team at the United Nations, based within the UN Office of Information and Communications Technology (UNOICT), supports the development and adoption of open source technologies across the UN system and in collaboration with external partners. The team works to advance digital public goods that address global challenges such as climate resilience, sustainable food systems, and inclusive digital participation.
Through initiatives including “Reboot the Earth” and other open source collaborations, our team enables early-stage ideas to mature into scalable, production-ready solutions. Our work emphasizes open collaboration, responsible use of emerging technologies such as AI, focusing on deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. The Open Source Team also provides technical guidance, mentorship, and governance support to ensure projects not only align with UN values but also prioritize long-term sustainability.
