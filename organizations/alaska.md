## Description

Alaska Project Ideas are mentored by the researchers and collaborators of the University of Alaska and supported by other open-source entities in Alaska, such as Alaska Dev Alliance.

We aim to represent the open-source ecosystem of the 49th state, Alaska. Anchorage, the largest city in Alaska, has a vibrant open-source community. Through this GSoC initiative, industrial experts who are part of the Alaska Developer Alliance and faculty and researchers from the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) join hands to provide a perfect mentoring experience for interested contributors globally. We offer a glimpse of this northern state and its tech landscape to the Lower 48 and the outside world through this open-source remote summer coding program organized and funded by Google. Our projects focus on healthcare, climate science, polar science, and other research fields critical to the Circumpolar North and the rest of the world.
