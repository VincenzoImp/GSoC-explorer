Spend your summer doing something exciting and valuable for the open-source community, and join Google Summer of Code. Read more about how the program works on [this page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

OpenVINO Toolkit has been [a mentoring organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEYysqPhX3s) since 2022!

Take a look at our other organization ([Open Edge Platform](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-resources/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code)) for more exciting projects - it was spun off from the OpenVINO Toolkit in 2026.

## Announcements

Please subscribe [this discussion](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/discussions/33737) and check it regularly for important announcements. 

## Prerequisite task

We require one pull request sent to our OpenVINO repository from each potential GSoC contributor before accepting participation for GSoC. We would like to see if you know how to code, use git and GitHub, and your coding style. To fulfill this requirement, please:

1. Visit the [OpenVINO Good First Issues board](https://github.com/orgs/openvinotoolkit/projects/3).
2. Select one of the unassigned tickets ("Contributors Needed" column) and ask for the assignment.
3. Discuss the solution with the OpenVINO developers.
4. Implement it according to the [OpenVINO contribution guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
5. If you encounter any issues talk to our developers on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7pVRxUwdWG).
5. Create a new pull request with your work.
6. Wait for the review and eventual merge.

Please note the above task is **mandatory**. However, we reserve the right to review and merge only the selected PRs. Not merging or closing your PR doesn't change your chances of being accepted for GSoC. Due to the expected large number of requests, the review process can be delayed, so please be patient.

If you're unfamiliar with git and GitHub, check out this [blog](https://medium.com/openvino-toolkit/how-to-contribute-to-an-ai-open-source-project-c741f48e009e). The blog is about contributing to OpenVINO core project, but the workflow is the same for all projects.

## Application Template

**Purely AI-generated applications are not allowed and will result in disqualification. Applicants must author their submissions themselves and be able to fully explain all content. AI tools may only be used to check grammar, punctuation, or slightly improve language style; they must not generate ideas, write sections of the application, or replace the applicant’s own reasoning. Submissions that appear to be primarily AI-generated will be rejected. The guiding principle is that AI may assist in polishing your application, but it cannot replace your thinking, creativity, or voice.**

Your application should consist of the following parts:

1. About you
    1. Your full name
    2. Your university/current enrollment
    3. The timezone you live/work in
    4. Short bio
    5. Your experience in programming (especially C++ and Python)
    6. Your experience in technologies required for the project
2. About the project
    1. What is your choice?
    2. Why did you choose this specific idea?
    3. How much time do you plan to invest in the project? 
    4. Provide an abstract of the solution
    5. Provide a detailed timeline of how you want to implement the project (include the main points you want to cover and dates)
3. General questions
    1. How do you know OpenVINO?
    2. What do you know about OpenVINO? 
    3. Have you already contributed to the OpenVINO project? (please include links)
    4. How could you apply it to your professional development?
    5. Describe any other career development plan you have for the summer in addition to GSoC.
    6. Why should we pick you?
4. Prerequisites
    1. Link to your pull request (for the prerequisite task – the top part of this document), even if it is already merged or closed

Proposal examples can be found [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-1) and [here](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/proposal-example-2). Please get in touch with us early to discuss your application with the mentor.

The proposal must be uploaded to the GSoC website **during the GSoC contributor application period** (according to the dates in [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)) and **have the same name as the project name** (that will prevent your submission from being missed).

### AI Usage Policy for Google Summer of Code Contributions

This policy defines acceptable use of AI tools in GSoC contributions to ensure code quality, accountability, and learning outcomes.
Core Rules

1. Ownership and understanding

    * Contributors must fully understand and be able to explain all submitted changes.

2. No raw AI output

    * All AI-assisted content must be reviewed, modified, and owned by the contributor.
    * Non-conforming, unnecessary, or low-quality code must be rewritten or removed.

3. Build and test requirements

    * All changes must compile.
    * Appropriate tests must be added and must pass.
    * Untested or unbuilt code is not acceptable.

4. AI is an assistant, not an author

    * AI may be used only for research, learning, understanding, and test exploration.
    * AI must not be the primary problem-solving or code-generating mechanism.

**Please note the final decision of accepting code written with the help of AI is up to the project mentor.**
