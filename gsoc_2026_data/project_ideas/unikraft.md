## Unikraft Project Ideas

Thank you for your interest in participating in [Google Summer of Code 2026 (GSoC26)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026)!

Unikernels are a novel Operating System (OS) model providing unprecedented optimization for software services.
The technology offers a clean slate OS design which improves the efficiency of cloud services, IoT and embedded system applications by removing unnecessary software layers by specializing the OS image.
One unikernel framework which provides minimal runtime footprint and fast (millisecond-level) boot times is Unikraft, and aims as a means to reduce operating costs for all services that utilize it as a runtime mechanism.

Unikraft is a Unikernel Development Kit and consists of an extensive build system in addition to core and external library ecosystem which facilitate the underlying functionality of a unikernel.

### Unikraft as a Library

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 3/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175 or 350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Familiarity with build systems and linking, good OS concepts, Linux CLI. |

#### Description

As an SDK (Software Development Kit), Unikraft provides the build system and tooling to build your application as a unikernel.
The application source code files are selected and then compiled, together with the unikernel source code files.
Then they are all linked together in a final unikernel image that is run a virtual machine.

This process is complicated, as the application itself needs to adapted to the Unikraft build system.

Another approach is using the [POSIX binary compatibility layer](https://unikraft.org/docs/internals/syscall-shim) and run ELF binaries directly on top of Unikraft.
This, however, sacrifices performance for usability.

We propose a middle ground: build Unikraft as a static library that will then be linked to the application object files.
This will give good performance benefits, while simplifying the build process of applications with Unikraft.
There will be need to configure Unikraft and / or to work with the Unikraft build system.

### Expanding the Unikraft Software Support Ecosystem

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 3/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175 or 350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 2 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Basic OS concepts, familiarity with POSIX and system calls, build systems and tool stacks. |

#### Description

One of the weak points of most unikernel projects has always been application support, often requiring that applications be ported to the target unikernel OS.
With Unikraft we have been making a strong push towards POSIX compatibility so that applications can run unmodified on Unikraft.
We have been doing this in two different ways:

1. by adding support for the Musl libc library such that applications can be compiled against it, using their native build systems, and then linked into Unikraft
1. through [binary-compatibility mode](https://unikraft.org/docs/concepts/compatibility), where unmodified ELFs are directly executed in Unikraft and the resulting syscalls trapped and redirected to the Unikraft core, via the [`app-elfloader`](https://github.com/unikraft/app-elfloader).

This has lead to the creation of the [application `catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog) where running applications and examples are brought together.

This project focuses on expanding Unikraft's software support ecosystem by [adding new applications](https://unikraft.org/docs/contributing/adding-to-the-app-catalog) to the [application `catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog), primarily in binary-compatibility mode.
While doing this, you will also:

1. implement and extend system calls
1. add extensive testing for the application or framework that is to be included in the catalog
1. add benchmarking scripts to measure the performance and resource consumption of the application running with Unikraft
1. conduct synthetic tests using tools such as [the Linux Test Project](https://linux-test-project.github.io/)

The success of this project will directly impact Unikraft adoption.
The project length can be varied depending on which of these items are covered by the project.

### Software Quality Assurance of Unikraft Codebase

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 3/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175 or 350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 2 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | C programming skills, Linux command-line experience, build tools |

#### Description

During its years of existence, Unikraft has grown in features, application support and codebase.
As it matures, a high quality of the code and robust behavior are a must to provide a stable solution for its user base.

The aim of this project is to assist in the software quality assurance of the Unikraft codebase, by tackling one of the following ideas:

1. The use of the [`uktest` framework](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/uktest) to create unit tests for [internal libraries](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/tree/staging/lib/) and [external libraries](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alibrary+org%3Aunikraft+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories).
   Not many libraries have unit tests, those that do are mostly exceptions.
   This will directly impact the stability of the code base and allow quick validation of new features that may break existing functionality.

1. Inclusion of static and dynamic analysis tools that highlight potential spots of faulty or undefined behavior.

1. The use of compiler builtins and compiler flags providing constraints on the code to increase its resilience to faulty behavior.

1. Augmenting the CI/CD system used by Unikraft (based on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)) to feature automatic testing, validation and vetting of contributions to Unikraft repositories: core, libraries, applications.
   Potential items are:
   1. handling running of unikernels instead of simple builds
   1. static analysis of images to be delivered as reports to GitHub pull requests
   1. regression checks on performance (delivered as % change from the current upstream version)

Any other project that is targeted towards increasing the robustness of Unikraft source code is welcome.
These will both increase the viability of Unikraft as a stable solution and increase the quality of future contributions, by enforcing good practices on submitted code.

### Supporting macOS networking

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 3/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175 or 350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good Go skills, familiarity with virtualization, macOS and networking, good OS knowledge |

#### Description

[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit), the supporting codebase for the modular library operating system Unikraft designed for cloud native applications, provides users with the ability to build, package and run unikernels.
As a Swiss-army-knife of unikernel development, it eases both the construction and deployment of unikernels.
To this end, supporting diverse user environments and their ability to run unikernels locally supports the ultimate goal of the project.  One such environment which requires more attention is macOS.

Towards better facilitating the execution of unikernel virtual machine images on macOS, this project aims to introduce new packages which interface directly with macOS environments by interfacing natively with the local networking environment such that the execution of unikernels is accessible through a more direct communication mechanisms of the host.
Until now, the project only supports Linux bridge networking with accommodation (albeit "stubs") in the codebase for Darwin.

### Supporting User-provided, Long-lived Environmental Variables for Unikraft Builds

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 2/5 |
| **Project Size** | Medium (175 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good Go skills, familiarity with build tools, good OS knowledge |

#### Description

Unikraft is a highly modular library operating system designed for the cloud.
Its high degree of modularization allows for extreme customization and specialization.
As such, its tooling should not interfere with the user's desire to support such customization.
Towards increasing the unikernel's developer's ability to customize the build whilst simultaneously automating the process of retrieving, organizing and generally facilitating the build of a unikernel based on Unikraft and its many components, the supported tooling, [kraft](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit), should allow for the injection of the user's environment and or additional toolchain requirements.

This project is designed to better facilitate the dynamic injection of user provided variables into Unikraft's build system through the addition of a dynamically configured toolchain towards greater customization of the unikernel build through the use of its command-line companion client tool, `kraft`.
This manifests itself as an injection into KraftKit's core configuration system and must propagate across the codebase appropriately.

Distinct results of this addition would enable, but are not limited to: alternating the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version, providing alternative compile-time flags, and more.

### Unikernel Remote Builds Server

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 4/5 |
| **Project Size** | Large (350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good Go skills, familiarity with virtualization, good orchestration knowledge, good networking knowledge |

#### Description

[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit), the cli tool used by Unikraft provides users with the ability to build, package and run unikernels.
These builds are currently executed locally, which may not be ideal for all users that may not own a powerful machine or may want to offload the build process to a remote server.

To this end, this project aims to introduce a new package which interfaces directly with a remote server environment by implementing a client-server architecture for remote unikernel builds.
`kraft` will act as the client, sending build requests to a remote server, which will execute the build and send back the results to the client to place in the current directory at known paths.
Moreover, an initial implemntation of the server needs to be created, which will be responsible for receiving build requests, executing them and sending the results back to the client, whilst cleaning up the environment after the build is done.
This server could also be `kraft` itself, running in server mode and listening for build requests from other `kraft` invocations.

### Add KraftKit Support for Hyperlight

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 4/5 |
| **Project Size** | Large (350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good Go skills, familiarity with virtualization, decent kernel programming knowledge |

#### Description

[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit), the companion tool used by Unikraft can be used also to run unikernels locally using various hypervisors.
Currently, KraftKit supports both QEMU and Firecracker as KVM VMMs.
It also supports Xen through the use of `xl` toolstack.
To increase support for other tools, this project aims to add support for [Hyperlight](https://github.com/hyperlight-dev/hyperlight), a new VMM using the Linux `kvm` module for lightweight virtualization.
Similar to both the [QEMU](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/tree/staging/machine/qemu) and [Firecracker](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit/tree/staging/machine/firecracker) packages, a new one needs to be created for Hyperlight, such that the command `kraft run` would be able to run unikernels using Hyperlight as the underlying VMM.
Development will be incremental, starting with basic "Hello World" functionality, and later adding support for networking, storage and other features.

### Enhance KraftKit's Testing Suite

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 3/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175-350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good Go skills, familiarity with testing, basic Linux CLI knowledge |

#### Description

[KraftKit](https://github.com/unikraft/kraftkit), the tool used to build, package, and run unikernels based on Unikraft, has a minimal set of tests.
To ensure the stability of the codebase and to prevent regressions, this project aims to enhance the testing suite of KraftKit by adding new tests for existing functionality, as well as for new features.
Sample tests exists throughout for both unit tests and integration tests, but these lack breadth.
The project aims to first target internal packages that require unit testing by doing a bottom-up approach.
At the same time, integration tests for the untested `kraft` commands need to be added as a top-down approach.

### Fine-Tuning Unikraft's Performance

| | |
|-|-|
| **Difficulty** | 4/5 |
| **Project Size** | Variable (175 or 350 hours) |
| **Maximum instances** | 1 |
| **Constraints/requirements** | Good C skills, familiarity with general operating system concepts, good testing knowledge |

#### Description

Over the past releases the development focus of Unikraft has been set on improving its compatibility with existing code bases and adding missing operating system features.
This means that less efforts were dedicated to performance-testing Unikraft, resulting in a potential loss of performance in recent releases.
Now that Unikraft is reaching the desired level of maturity and compatibility, it is time to go back to evaluating and fine-tuning its performance.

The aim of this project is to 1) evaluate the current performance of Unikraft, 2) identify potential performance bottlenecks, and 3) address these bottlenecks through targeted patches.
- To evaluate the performance of Unikraft, this project will base on the evaluation of the Unikraft EuroSys paper, re-running experiments with the latest release of Unikraft.
  The first phase of the project will be to create a new repository with updated experiments that can easily be run in a push-button manner (deliverable 1).
- Following this, bottlenecks will be identified.
  Performance bottlenecks may lie in any Unikraft component: this will be a unique opportunity to touch on many operating system concepts.
  Performance bottlenecks will be reported in the form of GitHub issues (deliverable 2).
- Finally, the project will aim to provide self-contained, targeted fixes for these bottlenecks in the form of GitHub Pull-Requests (deliverable 3).

This project is a unique opportunity to learn about performance evaluation and optimization in a production-grade operating system.
It is also an opportunity to participate in a potential academic journal submission of Unikraft by refreshing its evaluation.
