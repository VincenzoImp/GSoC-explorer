**Once you shortlist an idea, the next steps are outlined in Application Guide**

## List of Ideas

### 1. MCP Testing

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) acts as the API layer of the AI world, defining a standard way for AI agents to discover, understand, and interact with tools, data, and software systems—much like REST or GraphQL do for traditional applications.

In this project, your task is to strengthen the MCP Developer ecosystem by designing and building the capability to create & test MCP servers and clients.

**Skills**: AI, Python, React, Node, TypeScript

**Difficulty**: Medium-High

**Length**: 175 hours

### 2. Multimodal AI and Agent API Eval Framework

Develop an end-to-end AI and Agent API eval framework which should (list is suggestive, not exhaustive):

- Provide an intuitive interface to run AI benchmarks on tools (like lm-harness, lighteval).
- Provide a UI interface for configuring AI API requests, where users can input test/custom datasets, configure request parameters, send queries to various AI API services and view the eval results.
- Support evaluation of voice, image, text AI Models and AI Agents (via API interface) across various task benchmarks.

**Skills**: AI, Agents, Evaluations, Python, React, Node, TypeScript

**Difficulty**: Medium-High

**Length**: 350 hours

### 3. Git Support, UI Workflow Builder & Collection Dashboard

The objective of this project is to design and implement the following features in API Dash:

**Git Integration**- To support version control for API requests, environments, and workflows using familiar Git-based workflows. It will also help users share collections via git and collaborate on them.**Visual Workflow Builder**- Use Agentic AI to enable users to create node based API workflows directly from a prompt. The UI should also allow users to manually compose, export, connect, and manage multi-step API workflows (chained requests) through an intuitive UI, without relying solely on AI.**Collection Dashboard**- Build a dashboard to provide a unified view of requests, collections, workflows, test coverage, execution history, and health metrics. Also, add the ability to send automated reports via Webhooks.

**Skills**: Git, UI/UX Design, AI, Agents, Node Flows, Dart, Flutter

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard

**Length**: 175 hours

### 4. Agentic API Testing

Agentic AI transforms API and API-workflow testing from script-driven validation into an intelligent, autonomous quality layer. AI agents can understand the API specifications, contracts, workflows, and then automatically design comprehensive test strategies covering functional correctness, edge cases, error handling, security, and performance. These agents can execute multi-step API workflows end-to-end, maintain context across calls, manage dynamic data and state, and adapt test paths based on intermediate responses. If APIs change, agents can self-heal tests by updating schemas, parameters, and assertions without manual intervention.

Your task is to design, build, and refine the agentic AI library in API Dash and build AI agents that can understand API specs and workflows, generate and execute end-to-end tests, validate outcomes, and continuously improve test coverage and resilience as APIs evolve.

**Skills**: AI, Agent, API Testing, Dart, Flutter

**Difficulty**: Medium-Hard

**Length**: 175 hours

### 5. Open Responses & Generative UI

[Open Responses](https://www.openresponses.org) is an open-source specification and ecosystem for building interoperable, multi-provider LLM interfaces inspired by the OpenAI Responses API. It defines a common, vendor-neutral way to describe AI requests and structured response outputs, enabling portability and consistency across AI platforms. Complementing this, Google's [A2UI](https://github.com/google/A2UI) introduces clear guidelines for building Generative UIs, with first-class support available through Flutter's [GenUI SDK](https://github.com/flutter/genui).

Your task is to understand these specifications and build rich API response UI visualization in API Dash to enable end users to integrate the same in their Flutter Apps and Web Apps.

**Skills**: UX, AI, Parsing, JSON, Spec, Dart, Flutter, React, TypeScript

**Difficulty**: Easy-Medium

**Length**: 90 hours

### 6. CLI & MCP Support

This project focuses on creating a CLI tool to run API Dash via terminal. Contributors will design and implement command-line interfaces that expose core capabilities of API Dash that help in API testing. Also, your task is to expose API Dash as a MCP Server so that it can be run via any Agent interface (like VS Code, AI Apps, etc.) that supports MCP.

**Skills**: CLI, MCP, Dart, Flutter

**Difficulty**: Easy-Medium

**Length**: 90 hours

### 7. WebSocket, MQTT & gRPC

Testing WebSocket and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocols is crucial for ensuring the reliability, scalability, and security of real-time communication systems. Whereas, gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) facilitates efficient communication between distributed systems using Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its interface definition language (IDL) and offers features such as bi-directional streaming, authentication, and built-in support for load balancing and health checking. Each of these API protocols/styles serves different purposes and is utilized in various applications ranging from finance to web applications to IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The objective of this project is to design the architecture of the core library, understand the specs & implement the support for testing, visualization & integration code generation of these APIs in API Dash.

**Skills**: Understanding Specs/Protocols, UX Design, Dart, Flutter

**Difficulty**: Medium-High

**Length**: 175 hours

### 8. API Explorer

This project is designed to enhance the API user experience by providing a curated library of popular and publicly available APIs. This feature allows users to discover, browse, search, and directly import API endpoints into their API Dash workspace for seamless testing and exploration. Developers can access pre-configured API request templates, complete with authentication details, sample payloads, and expected responses. This eliminates the need to manually set up API requests, reducing onboarding time and improving efficiency. APIs spanning various domains—such as AI, finance, weather, and social media—are organized into categories, making it easy for users to find relevant services.

You are required to develop the entire process backend in the form of an automation pipeline which parses OpenAPI/HTML files, auto-tag it to relevant category, enrich the data, create templates. You can also add features such as user ratings, reviews, and community contributions (via GitHub) to ensure accurate and up-to-date resources.

**Skills**: UX Design, OpenAPI, Automation, Python, React, Nodejs, TypeScript

**Difficulty**: Easy

**Length**: 90 hours

Hi everyone! 👋 I've been looking through the GSoC 2026 ideas and I'm really interested in Idea To help me draft a solid technical architecture for my proposal, I just wanted to clarify how this specific framework will fit into the broader API Dash ecosystem. I'm completely comfortable handling the integration with the Dart client if that's the long-term goal. I just want to make sure I align my 350-hour timeline with the right architectural vision! |
