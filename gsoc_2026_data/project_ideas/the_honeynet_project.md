### GSoC and The Honeynet Project

During the previous years of GSoC, the Honeynet Project’s students have created a wide range of very successful open source security projects, many of which have gone on to become the industry standard open source tools in their respective fields.

We are also always interested in hearing any ideas for additional relevant computer security and honeynet-related R&D projects (although remember that to qualify for receiving GSoC funding from Google your project deliverables need to fit in to [GSoC’s project timescales](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)!). If you have a suitable and interesting project, we will always try and find the right resources to mentor it and support you.

Please note - even if you aren’t an [eligible GSoC participant](http://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq), we are also always looking for general volunteers who are enthusiastic and interested in getting involved in honeynet R&D.

Each sponsored GSoC 2026 project will have one or more mentors available to provide a guaranteed contact point to students, plus one or more technical advisors to help applicants with the technical direction and delivery of the project (often the original author of a tool or its current maintainer, and usually someone recognized as an international expert in their particular field). Our Google Summer of Code organizational administrators will also be available to all sponsored GSoC students for general advice and logistical support. We’ll also provide hosting for project infrastructure, if required.

For all questions about the Honeynet Project, the GSoC program or our projects, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/68B8Ru5fSU) (preferred)** or email us at [[email protected]](https://www.honeynet.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4e4c51545b5d4a7e5651505b47505b4a10514c59).

**Expected Project hours:**175 - 350 based on received proposal

### Project Overview

Currently GreedyBear obtains all its data from T-Pots Elastic stack. Some data that is collected by T-Pot however is not available there. Some honeypots, like Dionaea, collect payloads that are only written to the filesystem, that is to `~/tpotce/data`

. It would be great to make those artifacts available in GreedyBear. This project might not be limited to work on GreedyBear but can also include tinkering with the configuration of T-Pot itself or even introducing changes to T-Pot.

Related issues:

[https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/discussions/1653](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/discussions/1653)

### Goal

Have a clean and reliable way to

- access or extract payload files and other samples from T-Pot
- present them to the user in a safe manner

### Required Skills

- basic knowledge of Python, Linux and Docker
- motivation to deeply dive into both projects, GreedyBear and T-Pot, to create a stronger integration

### #5 - Greedybear: Dashboard Modularization

**Mentor:**Tim Leonhard, Matteo Lodi

[https://github.com/intelowlproject/Greedybear](https://github.com/intelowlproject/Greedybear)

**Expected Project hours:**175 - 350 based on received proposal

### Project Overview

GreedyBear obtains all its data by pulling it from a T-Pot instance. While this will always be the main data source, it would be great to build an API where external, authenticated applications can inject data into GreedyBear’s database. This API would accept incoming event data in a specified format, process and save it. This would give honeypot developers the option to use GreedyBear as a frontend / data store.

### Goal

Have a documented and tested API endpoint that enables GreedyBear to receive event data from other sources than T-Pot in a safe and reliable manner.

### Required Skills

- basic knowledge of Python
- motivation to thoroughly design and implement an API endpoint
