[GSoCGoogle Summer of Code](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22GSoC%22)Google Summer of Code

## Description

Welcome to our Google Summer of Code idea list for 2026!

Our projects are technical, demanding, and meant for students who genuinely want to learn by doing. We value careful thinking, solid fundamentals, and the ability to work independently more than flashy output. Quality matters here. If we’re not confident a collaboration will work well, we prefer not to take a student at all.

Before applying, take time to understand the project space. Read existing documentation and code, experiment locally, and ask precise, well-researched questions. Early pull requests, small but thoughtful, are strongly encouraged and are the best way to demonstrate seriousness and technical fit.

We do not accept AI-generated, low-effort proposals or submissions. If you use tools, you are still fully responsible for understanding and defending every line of what you submit.

If this sounds like the kind of environment you want to grow in, join the fuzzing Discord, introduce yourself, and start engaging early. The strongest applications usually come from students who do exactly that.

Below you find a list of potential projects, but you can come up with your own!
