## Background

Our projects are centered around changing how genomics analysis is done at scale. In an effort to advance cures for pediatric catastrophic diseases as quickly as possible, St. Jude has been sharing critical research data with the biomedical community for about 8 years now (see the [St. Jude Cloud paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33408242/) for more details). This endeavor has led to a great deal of experience in understanding the challenges of sharing this data with the broader academic community. To address those issues, we recently started our own workflow execution engine written in Rust called **Sprocket** aimed at enabling genomic analyses at petabyte-scale. Though we're focused on genomics, we think that Sprocket can be used for nearly all scientific domains.

Sprocket is built on top of the open Workflow Description Language ([github.com/openwdl](https://github.com/openwdl)), of which we have multiple people on the governance committee, and alongside the execution engine we're building, there are also many language design problems we're tackling such as building our own lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree, concrete syntax tree, linter, validation tools, language server protocol, VSCode plugin, formatter, and documentation generator. We're also building foundational Rust libraries for genomics through our [`omics`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/omics) project, which provides primitives for coordinates, molecules, and variations.

Last year, our GSoC contributor [Vaibhav Raj](https://github.com/dead8309) made substantial contributions to the Sprocket ecosystem, including 60+ commits implementing the core LSP features (auto-completions, semantic highlighting, go-to-definition, find-references, hover, and rename support), new linting rules, and critical bug fixes.

You can find out more by navigating to the links below:

- **https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket**. The user-facing command line tool that brings all of the functionality together. Check out [sprocket.bio](https://sprocket.bio) for documentation.
- **https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/sprocket/tree/main/crates**. The core `wdl-*` crates for the project, located in the Sprocket repository. These crates contain functionality covering the lexing, parsing, abstract syntax tree, concrete syntax tree, linting, validation, language server protocol, formatting, and documentation generation.
- **https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/crankshaft**. A headless workflow execution engine. The `crankshaft` crate(s) contain the language-agnostic plumbing code for submitting jobs to backend execution platforms (local, Docker, Cloud, HPC, etc).

## Projects

### Python bindings for Sprocket's WDL tooling

**Length:** 175 hours | **Difficulty:** Medium

#### Description

Python is the dominant language in bioinformatics, yet Sprocket's powerful WDL tooling (lexer, parser, linter, validator) is only accessible from Rust. This project creates Python bindings using PyO3 (or comparable), enabling Python developers to programmatically parse, lint, and validate WDL documents. This opens the door to a vibrant ecosystem of Python-based WDL tooling—IDE plugins, CI integrations, and analysis scripts—without reimplementing the core logic we've built up in Sprocket.

#### Outcomes

- A `sprocket-py` package exposing lexing, parsing, and linting APIs *(Project, Python developers)*
- Published to PyPI for easy installation *(Project, end users)*
- *(Stretch Goal)* Workflow execution APIs exposed to Python *(Project, stretch goal)*
- Experience with Rust FFI, PyO3 (or similar), and cross-language API design *(Contributor)*

#### Relevant Skills

Fluency in both Rust and Python. Experience with PyO3 or similar FFI tooling preferred but not required.

#### Potential Mentors

[Ari Frantz](https://github.com/a-frantz) w/ support from [Clay McLeod](https://github.com/claymcleod).

#### Proposal Advice

First, explore PyO3's (or similar) documentation and build a minimal Rust-to-Python binding. Then examine the `wdl` crate structure to understand which types would be most valuable to expose. Consider: What would a Python user expect from `import sprocket`? Include your findings in your application. Justify why you chose your approach to this problem. What other ancillary deliverables will be needed for community adoption?

### Plugin system for custom execution backends in Sprocket

**Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Hard

#### Description

Sprocket currently supports several execution backends (Docker, TES, LSF+Apptainer, Slurm+Apptainer), but organizations often have unique infrastructure requirements—currently unsupported HPC schedulers, cloud platforms, or specialized compute environments. This project researches and implements a plugin architecture that allows users to develop their own execution backends without modifying Sprocket's core. The contributor will study existing solutions (including Nextflow's plugin system), evaluate approaches for plugins in a compiled Rust world (WASM, dynamic libraries, RPC), and design an extensible backend interface.

#### Outcomes

- A plugin interface for execution backends with clear documentation *(Project, plugin authors)*
- At least one example plugin demonstrating the architecture *(Project, reference implementation)*
- Plugin loading and configuration mechanism integrated into Sprocket *(Project, end users)*
- Deep understanding of systems programming, plugin architectures, and Rust *(Contributor)*

#### Relevant Skills

Strong Rust skills required. Experience with systems programming, dynamic loading, or plugin architectures preferred. Willingness to conduct substantial research and propose novel solutions is essential.

#### Potential Mentors

[Clay McLeod](https://github.com/claymcleod)

#### Proposal Advice

Start by examining how Nextflow handles plugins ([Nextflow Plugins documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins/plugins.html)) and what extension points it offers. Then review Crankshaft's existing backend implementations to understand the current architecture. We've been considering several approaches: WebAssembly modules, subprocess-based plugins with JSON-RPC or similar transport, and dynamic shared libraries. Each has distinct tradeoffs around performance, portability, sandboxing, and language flexibility. **Your application should include a clear recommendation for which approach you believe is best and why**. We want to see your reasoning process and technical judgment, not just a summary of options.

### Type-safe genomic interval library for `omics`

**Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Hard

#### Description

Genomic interval operations are fundamental to bioinformatics pipelines, yet a persistent source of bugs is coordinate system mismatches—mixing interbase intervals (BED) with in-base intervals (VCF, GFF). This project builds a genomic interval library within the `omics` ecosystem that makes these bugs structurally impossible by leveraging Rust's type system. Intervals are parameterized by coordinate system at compile time, ensuring operations between incompatible systems won't compile. The library will support core overlap queries, full set algebra (union, intersection, difference, complement, merge), and streaming/iterator-based processing for large datasets.

#### Outcomes

- Type-safe interval types integrated with `omics::coordinate` *(Project, bioinformatics developers)*
- Efficient overlap queries using proven algorithms ([implicit interval trees](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32966548/), [augmented interval lists](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31150060/)) *(Project, pipeline authors)*
- Complete set algebra operations matching bedtools functionality *(Project, end users)*
- Streaming/lazy operations for memory-efficient processing of large datasets *(Project, large-scale analysis)*
- Deep understanding of genomic data structures and Rust type system *(Contributor)*

#### Relevant Skills

Strong Rust skills required. Familiarity with genomic coordinate systems and interval data structures preferred. Interest in leveraging type systems for correctness.

#### Potential Mentors

[Clay McLeod](https://github.com/claymcleod)

#### Proposal Advice

Start by reading the [omics-coordinate documentation](https://docs.rs/omics-coordinate) to understand the distinction between *interbase* (pointing to spaces between nucleotides) and *in-base* (pointing directly to nucleotides) coordinate systems—and why mixing them causes bugs. Review existing libraries like [rust-lapper](https://github.com/sstadick/rust-lapper), [coitrees](https://github.com/dcjones/coitrees), and [bedrs](https://lib.rs/crates/bedrs) to understand current approaches. Your proposal should explain how you'd leverage Rust's type system to prevent coordinate system mismatches at compile time.

### SIMD-accelerated sequence alignment for `omics`

**Length:** 350 hours | **Difficulty:** Hard

#### Description

Sequence alignment is fundamental to bioinformatics—comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to find similarities, identify mutations, or infer evolutionary relationships. Modern CPUs offer SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions that can dramatically accelerate the dynamic programming algorithms at the heart of alignment. This project builds a SIMD-accelerated alignment module for the `omics` ecosystem, including developing foundational primitives (protein sequence types, amino acid representations), alignment infrastructure (scoring matrices, gap penalty models, CIGAR result types), and high-performance implementations of global and local alignments.

#### Outcomes

- Protein sequence primitives: amino acid types, protein polymers extending `omics::molecule` *(Project, library foundation)*
- Alignment infrastructure: scoring matrices, gap penalties, result types *(Project, core types)*
- SIMD-accelerated Smith-Waterman (local) and Needleman-Wunsch (global) implementations *(Project, core algorithms)*
- Integration with existing `omics::molecule` DNA/RNA types *(Project, ecosystem cohesion)*
- Benchmarks demonstrating performance against existing tools *(Project, community)*

#### Relevant Skills

Strong Rust skills required. Familiarity with SIMD intrinsics (AVX2, NEON) or willingness to learn. Understanding of dynamic programming and sequence alignment algorithms preferred.

#### Potential Mentors

[Clay McLeod](https://github.com/claymcleod)

#### Proposal Advice

Start by understanding Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch algorithms, then explore how SIMD parallelism accelerates them. Review [Block Aligner](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner) ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37535681/)) as a reference for SIMD techniques. Examine `omics::molecule` to understand the current sequence representations—note that protein types, scoring infrastructure, and alignment result types will need to be built as part of this project. Your proposal should outline the primitives you'd create, your approach to SIMD acceleration, and how the API would feel to end users.
