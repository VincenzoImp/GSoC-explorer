### GSoC 2026 Project Ideas

**January 19, 2026.**

For the past 4 months, our large team of mentors and students from our different labs around the world has been talking and proposing ideas for this year's GSoC projects.

Now you can finally take a look at this year's Project Ideas, crafted with some nice changes to the past editions, including an embellishment of the ideas with the powerful new AI tools from Google, in this case mostly NotebookLM, Gemini, and Nano Banana Pro.

SO you have two ways to read the ideas:

- Or the simple but clear

[Google Sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhdtQ6PZoqbwHIFDoXDMfu4MW_-dYfnBqvpDGbRV1KU/edit?usp=sharing)**To keep it clear: all the documents have the same proposals, only the NotebookLM-powered ones have amazing graphics that catch the point about the spectacularity a visualization from Liquid Galaxy is.**

**Anyway, we recommend you browse first the slides, and when you have an idea of the project (Google allows you to present a maximum of three), look at the plain definition of the same idea in the Google Sheet.**

At this time, we are not going to comment further on proposals; we all have to wait till February 19 to continue the tasks (or stop). If we succeed, hopefully, plenty more info will appear here on the proposals and some new changes we have for this year's GSoC, that already have been comented in our community Meets, and are, among others:



- Reward the projects with a great history telling, by the obligatory for all projects use of:

. Presenting the KML's in 3D, coloured.

. Incorporating AI voices in your projects.

**- Allow the use of AI in your code creation and more, as stated in the**

[AI Clarification Policy note,](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2025/11/GSoC2026.html#ai)but implementing a self-review code process, as the Artificial Intelligence wave makes us all to work harder to detect fake work and bad non-maintainable code. Always next the guidance and supervision of your mentor and admins.

And some more that we'll communicate if successful on GSoC this year.

If you want a spoil, just look at

[Task 5](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2025/11/GSoC2026.html#task5), which can be done by anyone, at anytime, but with the rules already written in the post. If you have any doubt, as always, contact us on Discord if the question is open, or by email if it's private.**We're here to help you.**
