In 2026 HumanAI plans to participate in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization. The HumanAI organization will broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of arts and humanities fields. HumanAI participants will be mentored by domain experts and artists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of arts and humanities. Projects span a wide range of domains, including arts, music, languages, history, choreography, theatre, literature etc.

In 2026 GSoC students work with their mentors to produce open-source codes that apply machine learning solutions to art and humanities. Projects span three evaluation periods that allow for students and mentors to collaborate on their project and evaluate student progress. Detailed rules for the GSOC program can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
Interested students should look at the ideas page and contact the mentors. Candidates will be asked to complete an evaluation test for each project they apply to demonstrate the skills needed for the respective projects.
In the next step, students will produce a proposal which will be evaluated for final student selection.

AutoEIT is an applied machine learning project focused on automating the scoring of the Elicited Imitation Task (EIT), a research tool used to measure global language proficiency. The EIT is widely respected and is available for free in several languages, but the current workflow requires manual audio transcription and human scoring—slow, tedious, and error‑prone. This project aims to build an end‑to‑end system that will: Process raw audio files, perform accurate voice‑to‑text transcription, and automatically evaluate responses using a standardized scoring rubric.

While AI is re-shaping many facets of life today, its impact on the arts has garnered a particular interest by the general public. AI-generated artistic outputs are growing increasingly sophisticated, but artists themselves are too often left out of the development process for such tools, yielding a stark societal divide between AI developers and the artists who inspire them. Moreover, dance as an artistic discipline has been historically overlooked and misunderstood by the AI community. The mission of this project is to put dancers and technologists directly in conversation to construct radical new tools for AI-enabled choreography that are both state-of-the-art and artist-led.

The Healing Stones project aims at using AI in combination with existing digital scan models of fragments to develop a means for reconstructing fragmented cultural heritage artifacts in a virtual space.

The Mission of the Institute for Social Science Research (ISSR) at the University of Alabama is to promote and support high-quality social science research across various disciplines. The ISSR aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, to provide resources and support for social science research, and to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and understanding of social phenomena.

The Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP) is an international, interdisciplinary research collective. LAMP uses computational methods to reconstruct the embodied experiences of ancient buildings and landscapes. In so doing, the project crafts more accurate and embodied histories of religious communities across geographic and temporal contexts. Of particular interest to LAMP is how these embodied reconstructions might be leveraged to rewrite the history of the first centuries of Christianity. Our current project centers on the late antique necropolis of El Bagawat in Egypt’s Kharga Oasis. We are interested in developing machine learning approaches that will: 1) determine the pathways taken between buildings within the site, as well as recovering pathways no longer visible, and 2) allow to determine the visibility and audibility of any given point at the site from a particular location.

RenAIssance encompasses the use of optical character recognition (OCR) to digitize text sources that have not yet been targeted by existing tools. Its purpose is to explore machine learning techniques to enable OCR on a variety of materials that have never been digitized before. Additionally, RenAIssance aims to develop a comprehensive end-to-end tool for text recognition, streamlining the entire pipeline from image preprocessing to text extraction. It also seeks to establish a standardized benchmarking framework by collecting a common validation dataset, allowing for accurate ranking and evaluation of all previously developed models.

In recent years the world has seen that effective and efficient modeling of global health epidemics is critically important. This project aims to develop an openly available tool which can rapidly model potential epidemics by using machine learning to determine the parameters of a SIR epidemic model.

Colav ([https://github.com/colav](https://github.com/colav)) is a colaboratory for the development of computational social sciences and digital humanities. Our main contributions are in the development of computational strategies to evaluate research and advance the knowledge of science, technology, and innovation dynamics. We do innovative research for the management of data processing, especially data related to the creation of scholarly, scientific, and technological knowledge, contribute to open science policies and strategies, and the development of research metrics and assessment tools.
