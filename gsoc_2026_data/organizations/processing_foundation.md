## Description

Our mission is to promote software learning within the arts, artistic learning within technology-related fields, and to celebrate the diverse communities that make these fields vibrant, liberatory, and innovative. Our goal is to support people of all backgrounds in learning how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to tools and resources. We also believe that some of the most radical futures and innovative technologies are being built by communities that have been pushed to the margins by dominant tech. We hope to support those who have been marginalized by technology in continued self-determination by providing time, space, and resources.

We work toward our goals by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing (Java), p5.js (JavaScript), and p5.js Editor (JavaScript), and by facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.
