## Description

We are an Australian not-for-profit charity, founded in 2016, that serves as an umbrella organization for open-source projects. We believe the open-source philosophy is a resource-efficient approach to transfer knowledge, educate and innovate. 

We have almost 200 repositories in 3 GitHub spaces:
* https://github.com/orgs/AOSSIE-Org (our main space)
* https://github.com/StabilityNexus (for our blockchain projects)
* https://github.com/DjedAlliance (for our stablecoin projects)

Our projects span a wide range of topics and themes, including: financial stability, environmental sustainability, governance, trust, decentralized communication, artificial intelligence. The common ground under all our projects is our passion for making the world a better place, by empowering people with free software than can be run with minimal dependencies.

We have a diverse group of mentors, including GSoC students from previous years who decided to become long-term contributors as well as academics with extensive experience in supervising undergraduate, M.Sc. and PhD students on theses and projects, whose results are often published and presented in the most prestigious conferences of our research fields.
