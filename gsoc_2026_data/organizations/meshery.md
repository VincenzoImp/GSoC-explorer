## Description

As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.

Meshery is for all cloud and cloud native infrastructure.  Kubernetes-centric. Kubernetes not required.

Infrastructure diversity is a reality for any enterprise. Whether you’re running a single Kubernetes cluster or multiple Kubernetes clusters, on one cloud or multiple clouds, you’ll find that Meshery supports your infrastructure diversity (or lack thereof).

Meshery is for engineering teams. Whether you are a Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Developer, or Operator, Meshery provides a platform for you to collaborate on the design and operation of your cloud native infrastructure.

Whether making a Day 0 adoption choice, a Day 1 configuration and provisioning, or maintaining a Day 2 deployment, Meshery has useful capabilities in either circumstance. Targeted audience for Meshery project would be any technology operators that leverage Cloud and cloud native infrastructure.

Meshery is like Google Docs for DevOps. Using Meshery extensions you can freely collaborate across projects and team with multi-player infrastructure design and operation.

Meshery enables cloud native best practices with design patterns and the Meshery Catalog. Through Models, Meshery describes infrastructure under management, enabling you to define cloud native designs and patterns and then to export those designs and share within the Meshery Catalog.
