## Description

Kiwix provides copies of websites that can be browsed offline. We run scrapers that will crawl a given website and compress it into a single .zim archive (based on the openZIM format). <br/><br/>

The zim files can then be stored locally and read on the fly by Kiwix in such a way that the user experience is similar to being online. <br/><br/>

We can fit the entirety of Wikipedia on a regular Android phone, but there are more than 7,000 zim files available in 100+ languages, mostly focused on educational content (e.g. Wikipedia, StackOverflow, Khan Academy, etc.).

<br/><br/>

Kiwix runs on all platforms (Linux, Windows, Android, etc.) and has around 10-12 million users worldwide, in pretty much any place you can think of that has limited or no connectivity: prisons, rural schools, refugee camps, even Antarctic bases!
<br/><br/>
Our big challenge is to make it as easy as possible to access or share offline content.
