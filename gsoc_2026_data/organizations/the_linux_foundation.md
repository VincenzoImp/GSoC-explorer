## Description

The Linux Foundation is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux. Founded in 2007 as a merger of the former Free Standards Group (FSG) and the former Open Source Developer Lab (OSDL), the LF sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds and is supported by leading Linux and open source companies and developers from around the world. The Linux Foundation promotes, protects and standardizes Linux by providing unified resources and services needed for open source to successfully compete with closed platforms. For more see our [About page](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/). All software produced by us is free software published under OSI-approved licenses.
