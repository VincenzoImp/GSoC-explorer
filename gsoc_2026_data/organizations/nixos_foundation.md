## Description

Our role is to support the infrastructure and development of the NixOS project as a whole.

Most of the development is happening here:
https://github.com/nixos/nix - the Nix cli and language reference implementation

https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs - package definitions for the Nix package manager and NixOS source code

A few key points are:
- keeping our ci up and running
- hosting a trustworthy binary cache for the public
- providing documentation for everything Nix
- unblocking contributors and keeping things civil
