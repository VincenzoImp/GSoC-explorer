## Description

OpenMRS provides the foundational, electronic medical record technology for more than 6,500 health facilities in over 80 countries, touching and helping millions of patients throughout  the world.  

The OpenMRS Community’s mission is to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments. 

We coordinate a global community that creates and sustains a robust, scalable, user-driven and open-source medical record platform and reference frontend application.

We maintain a platform that countries and implementers use to create a customized EMR system in response to actual needs on the ground.
