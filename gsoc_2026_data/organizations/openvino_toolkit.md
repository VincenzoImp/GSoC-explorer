## Description

OpenVINO is an open‑source toolkit designed to optimize and deploy deep learning models from cloud to edge. It accelerates inference for a wide range of use cases—including computer vision, generative AI, and agentic AI—supporting models from popular frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and more. With OpenVINO, you can convert and optimize models, then deploy them across diverse Intel hardware and environments, whether on-premises, at the edge, on AI PCs, or in the cloud.
