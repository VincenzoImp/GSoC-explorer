## Description

JabRef is one of the most widely used citation and reference management tools. It helps students and researchers to stay on top of their literature by assisting at every step of a research project: collecting and organizing literature sources, discovering the latest research, citing references in LaTeX and other text editors, and sharing interesting papers with collaborators.

JabRef is open-source and cross-platform. It is written in Java using JavaFX as the user interface technology. It is licensed under the MIT license.

Since 2020 JabRef is maintained by the non-profit organization JabRef e.V.
