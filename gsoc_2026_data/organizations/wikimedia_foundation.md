## Description

Wikimedia strives to bring about a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge; through various projects, chapters, and the support structure of the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia officially supports 13 projects, including Wikipedia, the seventh most popular site on the internet. Wikipedia receives over 20 billion global page views every month and is available in over 300 languages. The tech behind it ensures that our projects are fast, reliable, and open to all. We design and build the open-source technology that powers Wikimedia projects from hosting Wikipedia to creating edit-checking artificial intelligence (AI). Community volunteers and Foundation technologists collaborate on MediaWiki, which makes sharing free knowledge possible. Read more about Wikimedia on our homepage: https://wikimediafoundation.org/
