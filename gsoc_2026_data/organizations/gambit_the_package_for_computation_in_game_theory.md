## Description

Gambit is a set of software tools for doing computation on finite, noncooperative games in extensive or strategy form and a set of file formats for storing and communicating games to external tools.

The Gambit Project was founded in the mid-1980s at the California Institute of Technology and to this day is actively developed by a community of contributors, with core development led by The Alan Turing Institute as part of its project: Automated analysis of strategic interactions.
