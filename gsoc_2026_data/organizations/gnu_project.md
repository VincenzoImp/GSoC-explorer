## Description

GNU is an operating system consisting entirely of free software, meaning it respects users’ freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages, which are programs released by the GNU Project, as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without relying on software that restricts or undermines user freedom. The GNU Project is the collective organization of maintainers and developers, webmasters, translators, and other contributors who develop and maintain more than 400 programs that together form the GNU operating system.
