## Description

The RUXAILAB is an open-source organization dedicated to democratizing usability and accessibility evaluation through the use of Artificial Intelligence. We provide a suite of AI-powered tools that enable remote usability and accessibility testing, ensuring that professionals and researchers can analyze user experience through different methodologies.

Our platform supports multiple methods such as User Testing, Heuristic Evaluation, Eye-Tracking system, Sentimental Analysis, a semi-automated tool for prototyping virtual reality environments in 2D, and heatmap analysis for advanced data extraction. 

Our mission is to eliminate financial and technological barriers to usability and accessibility research, making it possible for anyone, anywhere to set up their own usability lab at zero cost.

We invite developers, designers, and researchers to join us in expanding our toolkit, refining our existing solutions, and fostering a more accessible digital world. 🚀🌍
