## Description

LibreCube develops an ecosystem of open source space technology for exploration systems. 

Our vision is to enable everyone to get involved in building systems for exploration using open source hardware and software.

LibreCube is based on these three pillars: 


1) Open Source: Everything we do at LibreCube is made available to the public free and open source. Also, we only use free and open source tools for our work – this way, really everyone can get involved!


2) Free and Open Standards: We rely on proven and tested standards for our system designs, with preference for standards from the space domain.


3) Reference Architecture: Defining a generic architecture of system that have standardized interfaces makes it possible to combine and re-use elements for various different mission applications.
