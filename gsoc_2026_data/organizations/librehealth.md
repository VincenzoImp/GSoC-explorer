## Description

LibreHealth is the foundation of a worldwide ecosystem of open source Health IT innovation and is a place where people can come together to build tools that enhance the quality of healthcare around the world.

We currently have under our umbrella the following projects:

- LibreHealth Toolkit (http://librehealth.io/projects/lh-toolkit/), a foundational base for - building Health IT tools

- LibreHealth Radiology (https://librehealth.io/projects/lh-radiology), a specialized distribution of LibreHealth Toolkit customized for radiology healthcare professionals

Our GSoC student projects will address the real-life needs of our projects to help improve the delivery of health care around the world. We have a team of expert mentors with decades of experience to help you in your work. They will be continually adding project ideas to our forum (https://forums.librehealth.io), and we encourage you to suggest ideas too as you learn more about our projects.
