## Description

The Dart language gives you a fast developer experience and works on any platform. Dart powers hot reload enabling you to make a code change and instantly see results in your running app, and compiles to ARM and x64 machine code enabling quick app startup times for mobile, desktop and the web.

Dart powers Flutter, Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
