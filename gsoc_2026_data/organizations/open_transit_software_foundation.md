## Description

We are the home for the OneBusAway project. OneBusAway is a suite of open source transit information tools based on real-time vehicle data.

OneBusAway is a suite of open source transit information tools that enable transit agencies to provide real-time vehicle locations, alerts, and arrival information to riders, with iOS and Android apps, a web platform, and robust APIs, as well as back office support. OneBusAway lets transit agencies be in control, without needing to build everything themselves and without cutting corners.
