## Description

The FOSSi (Free and Open Source Silicon) Foundation is a not-for-profit organization with the support the growing community of open source silicon hardware. We do this with a variety of activities and through Google Summer of Code we bring together enthusiastic mentees and outstanding projects. Under our umbrella are open source silicon hardware projects, operating systems and compilers for such projects, tools for electronic design automation and the related ecosystem.
