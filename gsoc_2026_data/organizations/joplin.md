## Description

Joplin is a note-taking app designed with strong security and privacy in mind. It features end-to-end encryption (E2EE), ensuring the notes remain protected during synchronization. Users can store notes locally or sync them via trusted services like Nextcloud, Dropbox, or self-hosted servers, retaining full data ownership.

Additionally Joplin can manage a large number of notes that can be organised using notebooks or tags, thus making it suitable to manage a knowledge base. The notes can be searched using simple or advanced queries.

The application can be customised using plugins and themes, and you can also easily create your own. It is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS.
