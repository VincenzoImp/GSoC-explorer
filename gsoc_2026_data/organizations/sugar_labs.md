## Description

Sugar is an activity-focused, free/libre open-source software (FLOSS) learning platform for children. Collaboration, reflection, and discovery are integrated directly into the user interface. Through Sugar's clarity of design, children and teachers have the opportunity to use computers on their own terms. Students can reshape, reinvent, and reapply both software and content into powerful learning activities. Sugar's focus on sharing, constructive criticism, and exploration is grounded in the culture of free software and the ideals of learn-by-doing "Constructionism".
