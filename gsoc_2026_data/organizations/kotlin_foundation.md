## Description

Kotlin is a concise, modern, and versatile programming language designed for multiple platforms.

The Kotlin Foundation, established by JetBrains and Google, later welcomed Meta, Uber, Gradle, Touchlab, Block, and Kotzilla. Together, we promote and advance Kotlin across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, desktop, and server-side.
 
Currently, 100+ engineers from JetBrains and Google contribute to the core Kotlin project, alongside 350+ independent contributors and thousands more supporting the broader Kotlin ecosystem.

The Kotlin Foundation is committed to protecting, promoting, and advancing the evolution of the Kotlin language.
