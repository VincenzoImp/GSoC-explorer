## Description

Tiled is a 2D engine-agnostic level editor for games. Its primary feature is to edit different types of tile maps, but it also supports free image placement as well as powerful ways to annotate levels with extra information used by the game. Tiled focuses on general flexibility while trying to stay intuitive.
