## Description

The Rust Project is a group of developers and maintainers who build and support the Rust programming language. Organised into teams, they develop new features and mantain the Rust language, its compiler and standard library, and also all kinds of infrastructure that supports Rust. This application is being made by the Rust Foundation, the legal entity for the Rust Programming language, working in close association with representatives from the Rust Project.
