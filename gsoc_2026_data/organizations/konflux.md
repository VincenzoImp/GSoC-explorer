## Description

Konflux is an open source, opinionated Kubernetes-native software factory built on Tekton, focused on software supply chain security. It provides an end-to-end pipeline: hermetic builds from source, cryptographic signing, provenance attestation, vulnerability scanning, policy verification, and release automation. Konflux integrates with the broader supply chain security ecosystem (Sigstore, SLSA, Conforma) and is built by a welcoming community that values collaboration, transparency, and mentorship.
Contributors work with cutting-edge cloud-native technologies and help shape how we solve one of the most critical challenges in modern software delivery.
