## Description

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is a resource designed to provide broad community access to cancer genomic data. It provides a unique user­-friendly and "biology­-centric computational user interface", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.

The public instance of cBioPortal (https://cbioportal.org/) is one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The three papers documenting the cBioPortal: Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012; Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013; and de Bruijn et al. Cancer Res. 2023; have been cited more than 16,000, 17,000, and 800 times, respectively. There are more than 100 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes around the globe.

We are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands.
