## Description

The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) is a global collaboration of Assyriologists, museum curators, and historians working together to make the world’s earliest written records accessible online. CDLI focuses on cuneiform inscriptions dating back to the very beginning of writing around 3350 BC. Today, more than 500,000 such artifacts are held in museums and private collections worldwide, and CDLI has already digitally catalogued over 350,000 of them, helping researchers and the public explore humanity’s oldest written heritage.
