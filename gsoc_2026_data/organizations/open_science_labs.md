## Description

Open Science Labs is a global community dedicated to creating an open space for
teaching, learning, and sharing information about open science and computational
tools. Our community develops tools that address real-world problems and
collaborates with other projects and workgroups to improve technology and create
international opportunities for our community. Although our focus may seem
broad, we initially prioritize supporting Research Software Engineers (RSEs) who
often face computational challenges in their work. We recognize that many
colleagues in scientific fields may not be familiar with programming languages,
computational libraries, version control systems, databases, DevOps, and other
computational tools. Therefore, we aim to provide a safe and open space for
individuals to learn and share their knowledge. Our community is open to
everyone, including students, professors, and industry professionals, as we
believe that the challenges and technologies used in these fields are frequently
similar, if not the same (in many cases).
