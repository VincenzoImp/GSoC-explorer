## Description

Kornia AI is a non-profit organization advancing Spatial Artificial Intelligence through open collaboration. Founded in 2018 and  registered as a non-profit in 2023, Kornia AI is supported by a global contributor community. The organization began with Kornia, a widely adopted Python library for Differentiable Computer Vision (>2M downloads/month, 400+ Google Scholar citations).
 In recent years, the core maintainers have shifted focus to kornia-rs, a native Rust stack for high‑performance 3D computer vision and spatial AI. Our direction emphasizes robotics and edge deployment: safe, memory‑efficient, low‑latency pipelines that run on constrained devices (e.g., embedded/Jetson‑class hardware). kornia-rs is gaining traction in the open-source community and is used by leading companies such as Farm-ng, Rerun.io, and Copper Robotics, who have featured the project on their platforms.
