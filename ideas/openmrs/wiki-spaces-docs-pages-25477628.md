# Guide for the New and Curious

Thank you for your interest in joining the global OpenMRS Community! We're made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and skill sets, from development to translation, to create and maintain solutions to various countries' problems, as shown below.

This is an open-source project where your code, documents, QA testing, and translations can literally save lives. Your contributions help OpenMRS improve health care delivery in resource-constrained environments.

This page will help you get started by joining our communication channels and finding the right project team or squad that you want to contribute towards. Whether you are looking for a short-term project or to grow your contribution and skills over the long term, we hope this guide gives you the information you need to join the community and get started.

Technical Writing


**Step 4: Choose Your Flight Path and Begin Contributing**



**I've met the teams and squads, I've found a project I want to help, how do I begin contributing?**

Every project will have a home page full of relevant information, including meeting times, group members, communication channels, and other helpful links and resources. Some projects have guides that will help you get started with the technologies, tools, and repos they use.

As some projects operate differently from others, make sure to thoroughly read over their project pages to find the best means of contributing. This can include attending weekly meetings, assisting with documentation, or visiting a project's Jira board.

Get a feel for how the squad or team works together by attending their meetings, joining their Slack channel, and going through past meeting notes, Jira boards, or repos.

This list shows all active (happening now) initiatives in our Open Source Community: [Community Projects](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/embed/383844354?atl_f=PAGETREE)

A comprehensive list of each project and their specific page can be found here: [Development Projects](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/projects/pages/26938140)

**Step 5: Bookmark these Community Resources**

As you explore and begin the journey in the flight path of your choosing, a good way to ensure you make the most of your time in the OpenMRS community and also ensure marked growth and personal development in your skills and understanding of OpenMRS is to use the checklists listed below.

You will find these very useful in helping you track your overall progress and involvement regardless of the flight path taken. You can always come back to them periodically to ensure you are on track. Remember, the best way to build your reputation in the community is to be open and keep learning, advancing, and exploring.
