## Add glTF export for maps

**Labels:** Winter Of Code 4.0

For general interoperability with 3D engines and tools it would be nice to be able to export a map to a [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) file. I think [fx-gltf](https://github.com/jessey-git/fx-gltf) and [cgltf](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) look like interesting libraries to use for this purpose.
