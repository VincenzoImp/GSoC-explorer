## Mentors

Interested in volunteering with the Python Software Foundation?

**The biggest job is mentoring new contributors**: Mentoring a
GSoC contributor as a primary mentor can be a pretty big time commitment (see
"[What does it take to be a mentor?](https://python-gsoc.org#whatmentor)" for more information) but it's a very
rewarding chance to give a GSoC contributor an open source apprenticeship.
We mentor in teams, so if all you can handle is a few code reviews or taking
over for a week while someone's on vacation, you can team up with someone with more time.

**The easiest way to become a mentor is to be part of one of the sub-orgs
that plan to be involved**, so get in touch with them directly if you want to
help. If you're part of a group that would like to participate as a sub-org,
please read the section for sub-orgs below.

If you're not already part of a group that wants to participate, we can try to match you with one, but be aware that to do the best job of mentoring you're going to need to know the open source project pretty well yourself. If you're not already a developer, you should be prepared to become an active community member.

**But we often need other volunteers!** We're also looking for
friendly community members to help with other tasks! We'd love to have more
people available on IRC/Mailing lists to answer GSoC contributor and mentor
questions in various time zones. We are particularly looking for volunteers
who can read and comment on contributor posts, remind contributors if they haven't
posted, and promote the work our GSoC contributors do to the larger Python community.
Or maybe you have another skillset you'd like to contribute? (Proofreading?
Recruiting diverse contributor applicants?) If you want to help, we can try to
find a way to make that happen.

**If you'd like to volunteer, get in touch with a sub-org admin or
email the Python org admins at gsoc-admins(at)python(dot)org **
