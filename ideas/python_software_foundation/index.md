## What is it?

### Python

Python is a popular high-level programming language. It is a general-purpose language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

### Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers new contributors over 18 an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is an organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the Python programming language. Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has participated in Google Summer of Code, serving as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the Python language. Python provides mentors, Google provides the program (and the money!), and GSoC contributors write code!

GSoC 2026 has been announced!

## Python is hoping to apply to GSoC 2026, but right now we don't know anything! We will not have a list of sub-orgs until late January 2026 and there is no guarantee we will be accepted as a mentoring org.

Contributors: Please start with the [Python GSoC getting started guide](https://python-gsoc.org/#gettingstarted).
Our list of 2026 participating sub orgs can be found [on the ideas page](https://python-gsoc.org/ideas.html). Please talk to the organizations directly.
Now's a good time to get familiar with the projects and their needs.

Mentors and sub-orgs:
Please [contact the org admins](https://python-gsoc.org#contact) if you want to be part of GSoC 2026.
