Join the global community of developers
working towards the Freedom to Create.

GET

**STARTED**

Start by building Blender, read the docs while it compiles, and dive deep into Blender's architecture.

DO

**YOUR BIT**

Contribute by reporting issues, triage bugs from others, test and give feedback on experimental builds.

You don't need to be a developer to contribute to Blender.

**STAY**

UP-TO-DATE

One of the goals of Blender development is to be as transparent as possible.

Sharing notes from the meetings, code and design documentation.
