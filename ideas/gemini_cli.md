- Preferred: React/Ink, data visualization, OpenTelemetry

Difficulty: Medium | Size: 175 hours | Area: UX/UI

Enhance the Ink-based terminal UI to provide deep visibility into the agent's internal reasoning and tool execution chains. Currently, complex multi-step tasks can be a "black box" for users. This project involves building an interactive visualization that shows the hierarchy of tasks, tool calls, and model decisions in real-time, allowing users to "step through" execution like a debugger.

- Real-time task tree visualization in the Ink TUI
- "Step-through" mode where users must approve individual tool calls or agent decisions

- Improved error state visualization for nested agent failures
- User-configurable verbosity levels for different task categories

- Required: React (Ink), TypeScript, State Management
- Preferred: CLI UX design, experience with asynchronous UI updates, terminal rendering optimizations

Difficulty: Hard | Size: 175 hours | Area: Integration/DX

Integrate Gemini CLI with standard debugging protocols (DAP) to provide an interactive debugging companion. The agent should be able to attach to running processes (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.), set breakpoints, inspect stack traces, and query variable states to assist in root-cause analysis of bugs directly within the terminal interface.

- Debugger toolset for the agent using Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)
- Automated stack trace analysis and variable inspection tools
- Interactive "debug mode" where the agent can pause execution and ask for clarification
- Seamless integration with existing run_shell_command for launching debug sessions
- Automated fix suggestions based on runtime state inspection

- Required: Node.js, Debugger Internals (DAP), TypeScript
- Preferred: Experience with VS Code debugger extensions or LLM-driven debugging

Difficulty: Hard | Size: 350 hours | Area: Security

Implement a native Windows sandboxing driver using Windows AppContainer or the Windows Sandbox API. Currently, Gemini CLI on Windows relies on Docker Desktop for isolation. A native driver would provide a lighter, faster, and dependency-free experience for Windows users, utilizing OS-level security primitives to isolate file system and network access effectively.

- Native Windows sandbox driver implementation using AppContainer
- Parity with macOS Seatbelt for file system and registry restrictions
- Network isolation using Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)
- Automated setup and validation tool for Windows security features
- Performance benchmarks showing improvement over Docker-based isolation on Windows
- Detailed security audit of the native implementation

- Required: C#, Windows APIs (AppContainer, Win32), Node-API/TypeScript
- Preferred: Security-focused Windows development, experience with Windows Sandbox

Difficulty: Easy | Size: 90 hours | Area: Security/UX

Build a guided configuration "Wizard" to help users set up and manage security policies for different projects. The wizard will simplify the creation of Seatbelt profiles and Docker mount configurations, providing a user-friendly way to define "safe zones" and network permissions for the agent, ensuring that security is accessible even to non-experts.

- Interactive gemini sandbox-setup command with a guided UI
- Visual dashboard for reviewing and auditing active sandbox permissions
- Per-project policy file management (.gemini/policy.json)
- Template-based security profiles for common project types (Web, CLI, API)
- Real-time policy validation and conflict detection

- Required: React (Ink), TypeScript, Security concepts
- Preferred: CLI design, experience with security configuration or policy-as-code

Difficulty: Medium | Size: 175 hours | Area: Architecture/Security

Refactor the Gemini CLI's sandboxing logic into a modular, plugin-based driver architecture. Currently, sandboxing logic is split across the CLI and Core packages with many platform-specific conditional checks. This project involves creating a clean SandboxDriver interface that abstracts away the platform-specific details, making it easy to support macOS Seatbelt, Linux Bubblewrap, Windows AppContainer, and Docker through a unified API. This architecture will serve as the foundation for all future native sandboxing implementations.

- A well-defined SandboxDriver TypeScript interface and lifecycle manager in @google/gemini-cli-core.
- Refactored macOS Seatbelt and Docker/Podman implementations using the new interface.
- A "No-Op" driver for unsandboxed environments that provides consistent logging and warnings.
- Support for dynamic driver discovery and selection based on host OS and user configuration.
- Improved error handling and diagnostic tools for sandbox initialization failures.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the new driver lifecycle.

- Required: TypeScript, Software Architecture (SOLID principles), Node.js.
- Preferred: Experience with plugin systems or abstraction layers, cross-platform development, systems programming concepts.

Difficulty: Hard | Size: 350 hours | Area: Innovation/Multimodal

Transform Gemini CLI into a hands-free, conversational coding partner—your personal J.A.R.V.I.S. for software development. This project builds a real-time, bidirectional voice interface where developers can speak naturally to the agent and hear responses read aloud. Unlike basic speech-to-text wrappers, this leverages Gemini's native multimodal audio capabilities for a fluid, continuous conversation with minimal latency.

- Real-time voice input/output using Gemini's native audio streaming API
- Multiple activation modes: Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Push-to-Talk (hotkey), Wake Word ("Hey Gemini")
- Visual feedback: animated waveform visualizer showing listening/speaking/processing states
- Interruption support: speak to stop the agent's current response
- Voice-optimized response formatting (concise, spoken-friendly output)
- Audio feedback and text-to-speech for agent responses with configurable voices
- Noise cancellation and multi-accent robustness

- Required: TypeScript/Node.js, Audio processing (PCM, WAV, WebAudio), Real-time streaming
- Preferred: Gemini Multimodal API, Voice Activity Detection, Whisper integration, accessibility engineering

Difficulty: Medium | Size: 175 hours | Area: Innovation/UX

Break the "text-only" constraint of the terminal by teaching Gemini CLI to draw. This project enables the agent to generate and render visual artifacts directly in the terminal console—architecture diagrams, dependency graphs, data flow visualizations, and even live previews of generated UI components. Using Mermaid.js for diagrams and terminal image protocols (Sixel, iTerm2, Kitty) for rich graphics, developers can finally see what they're building without context-switching to a browser or IDE.

Imagine asking "explain the authentication flow" and seeing a beautifully rendered sequence diagram appear inline. Or generating a React component and instantly seeing a pixel-perfect preview in your terminal. This transforms the CLI from a text interface into a visual development environment.

- Inline rendering of architecture diagrams (Sequence, Class, ERD, Flowcharts) generated from codebase analysis
- Live preview of generated frontend components (HTML/CSS/React) rendered as terminal images
- Support for multiple terminal image protocols: Sixel, iTerm2 inline images, Kitty graphics protocol
- Intelligent ASCII/ANSI box-drawing fallback for unsupported terminals
- New tool: visualize for on-demand diagram generation
- Integration with explain command ("Explain this architecture" → renders diagram)
- Dependency graph visualization for package.json/requirements.txt
- Git history visualization (branch graphs, contributor timelines)
- Caching layer for rendered images to avoid regeneration

- Paradigm shift: No CLI coding tool renders rich graphics—this is genuinely new
- Frontend developer appeal: Instant visual feedback without leaving the terminal
- Viral demo potential: Terminal diagrams are visually striking and shareable

- Required: TypeScript/Node.js, Image processing (Sharp, node-canvas), streaming I/O
- Preferred: Terminal graphics protocols (Sixel, iTerm2), Mermaid.js/Graphviz, Puppeteer for HTML rendering
