Welcome to the **GeomScale** Google Summer of Code 2026 wiki! 

[GeomScale](https://geomscale.github.io) is an open-source organization focused on scalable computational geometry and geometric statistics. It develops state-of-the-art algorithms and efficient implementations for sampling, optimization, and analysis of constraint spaces, driving advancements in fields such as machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. A key aspect of GeomScale's activities includes applying its software to real-world problems and developing specialized tools for quantitative finance and computational biology.

This wiki will be the central hub of information regarding the **GeomScale** participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026. Administrators are Vissarion Fisikopoulos (<vissarion.fisikopoulos@gmail.com>), Apostolos Chalkis (<tolis.chal@gmail.com>) and Elias Tsigaridas (<elias.tsigaridas@gmail.com>). 

Everyone who wants to participate in Google Summer of Code with **GeomScale** should:
- read [what GSoC is about](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about), have a look at [past GSoC programs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive), read [the announcement blog post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/12/shape-future-with-google-summer-of-code.html) as well as the [Program Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules).
- join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/geomscale-gsoc) where announcements about projects will take place, 
- join **GeomScale** community channel on [gitter](https://gitter.im/GeomScale/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link), which is mostly for real time communication.

### Overview of the program

In short, each contributor selected for a GSoC project will get paid to work on a **GeomScale** related topic for (i) ~175 hours (medium sized projects), (ii) ~350 hours (large projects) or (iii) ~90 hours (small sized projects) during the summer:

- **Mentors** can propose projects to give ideas to contributors. Please read the [mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor), to learn more about what it means to be a mentor for an organization and creating appropriate project ideas (90, 175 and 350 hour projects).
- **Contributors** should look at the [list of projects](https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc26/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects) to see if any project interests them. Before emailing project mentors, please do at least one project **test**. Then email the project mentors to express your interest, and describe any prior experience.
- If a contributor can provide a link to a `C++/R/python` repository (*depending on the project*) with at least 1,000 lines, non-coursework open source code this will definitely strengthen their application. Code should have been open sourced at least three months ago, and show a log of commits improving the library over time.
- After opening communication with project mentors, each contributor must write an application with a detailed timeline, following this [application template](https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc26/wiki/application-template). Successful applications are shared with mentors for feedback before submission of a final application on [Google](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). The application should contain the solutions of the **tests** of the project in a separate section.
- Google will award a certain number of contributor slots to **GeomScale**. The project administrators and mentors of **GeomScale** will rank submitted projects in order of application quality and importance to the **GeomScale** project, and the top projects will be funded.
- Contributors get paid a [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) by Google for writing free/open-source code for a fixed period during the summer.
- Mentors get code written for their project, but no money.
  
### Proposed Projects 

See: [table of proposed coding projects](https://github.com/GeomScale/gsoc26/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects)

### AI Assistance Policy

GeomScale welcomes the use of AI tools to assist with learning, research, drafting ideas, and refining your understanding of project requirements. However, all final submissions must demonstrate contributor's comprehension and ownership of the technical content.

Requirements for AI use:

1. The contributor must perform manual inspection: They must read, understand, and verify every line of AI-generated code, text, or output before including it in tests, proposals, or code repositories.

2. The contributor must provide full disclosure: In their proposal and test submissions, they must clearly state: (1) which AI tools/agents were used (e.g., "ChatGPT 5.2, thinking model"), (2) how they were used (e.g., "generated initial proposal draft, refined with manual edits"), and (3) what manual changes they made (e.g., "added specific Netlib LP format details based on reading the README").

3. Raw AI output will be rejected: Proposals or tests that appear to be unedited AI-generated content (e.g., generic phrasing, lack of project-specific technical depth) will not advance. Mentors expect evidence of the contributor's engagement, such as custom examples, detailed timelines, or code demonstrating understanding of GeomScale repositories code internals.
