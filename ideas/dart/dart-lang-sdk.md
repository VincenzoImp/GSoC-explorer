Dart is:

-
**Approachable**: Develop with a strongly typed programming language that is consistent, concise, and offers modern language features like null safety and patterns. -
**Portable**: Compile to ARM, x64, or RISC-V machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend. Compile to JavaScript or WebAssembly for the web. -
**Productive**: Make changes iteratively: use hot reload to see the result instantly in your running app. Diagnose app issues using[DevTools](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-devtools).

Dart's flexible compiler technology lets you run Dart code in different ways, depending on your target platform and goals:

-
**Dart Native**: For programs targeting devices (mobile, desktop, server, and more), Dart Native includes both a Dart VM with JIT (just-in-time) compilation and an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiler for producing machine code. -
**Dart Web**: For programs targeting the web, Dart Web includes both a development time compiler (dartdevc) and a production time compiler (dart2js).

Dart is free and open source.

Our API reference documentation is published at [api.dart.dev](https://api.dart.dev),
based on the stable release. (We also publish docs from our
[beta](https://api.dart.dev/beta) and [dev](https://api.dart.dev/dev) channels,
as well as from the [primary development branch](https://api.dart.dev/be)).

If you want to build Dart yourself, here is a guide to
[getting the source, preparing your machine to build the SDK, and building](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/docs/Building.md).

There are more documents in our repo at [docs](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/main/docs).

The easiest way to contribute to Dart is to [file issues](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues).

You can also contribute patches, as described in [Contributing](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Future plans for Dart are included in the combined Dart and Flutter
[roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/roadmap/Roadmap.md) on the Flutter wiki.
