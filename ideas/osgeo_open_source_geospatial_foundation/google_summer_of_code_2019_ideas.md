## OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2019

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org) would like to extend a welcome to all SoC students. On this page you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you, and serve as example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcomed - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open source leaders and the future of the geospatial industry; show us what you've got!

**Students: check out the**([Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students)page. If you need more information on how to apply you can contact all the mentors via the OSGeo-SoC mailing list[see below](https://wiki.osgeo.org#How_to_get_in_contact_via_mailing_lists)) And look at[GSoC Roles and Responsibilities](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities)to understand a successfull teamwork and interplay of project, mentors and students.

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/resources/flyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

- Ok,
[OSGeo](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo)is involved in working with maps and things, but what kind of projects does it really do? Have a look at the[live blog feed](http://planet.osgeo.org/)to see what people are working on right now.

- Mentors, there's an additional link providing some tips and specifying your responsibilities on the main OSGeo
[Google Summer of Code 2019 Administrative](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2019_Administrative)wiki page.

## The ideas pages

**[Check back often, it's a work in progress]**

To add your page, **please contact the GSoC admin team** to let them know of your ideas page, by sending an email to [gsoc-admin@osgeo.org](mailto:gsoc-admin@osgeo.org)

Each participating project's list of ideas is on the respective projects' wikis, with a short description of the project and what type of students would be interested in it:

### OSGeo Foundation graduated projects

:**QGIS**Ideas[QGIS](https://qgis.org)is a user friendly Open Source GIS that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. QGIS supports vector, raster, and database formats. It is written in C++ and Python.



:**GRASS GIS**SoC Ideas[GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org)is an open source GIS focusing on analysis, modeling and visualization. It is a collection of modules written in C and Python and has a GUI written in wxPython. If you know Python, or want to implement algorithms in C, take a look!



:**PostGIS**Ideas[PostGIS](http://postgis.net)spatially enables the popular PostgreSQL object-relational database, allowing it to be used as a back-end database for geographic information systems (GIS) and web-mapping applications.



: gvSIG is a free GIS project for**gvSIG**Ideas[Desktop](http://www.gvsig.com/en/web/guest/products/gvsig-desktop). The gvSIG project looks for students with Java or Python skills that want to develop new ideas on this software.



### OSGeo Foundation community projects

:**pgRouting**Ideas[pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org)extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality and more.



### OSGeo Guest Projects

:**MapMint**Ideas[MapMint](http://mapmint.com/)is an internet-based Geographic Information System (GIS), which is designed to facilitate deployment of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). MapMint combines various different software in a complete and coherent web mapping platform, thus helping users in building their own maps and web-applications."



### Don't see in the list the project you're interested in?

Contact them in their developers mailing list! Feel free to propose your own idea and get feedback!

## I want to apply as a student

Before applying as a student, check out the [Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students) page.

### Which project do I choose?

Most of the software projects are available pre-built on our Live demo { DVD | USB stick | VirtualMachine } with project overviews and short tutorials where you can try everything out.
