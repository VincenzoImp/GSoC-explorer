## OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2015

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org) would like to extend a welcome to all SoC students. On this page you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you, and serve as example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcomed - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open source leaders; show us what you've got.

**Students: check out the**([Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students)page. If you need more information on how to apply you can contact all the mentors via the OSGeo-SoC mailing list[see below](https://wiki.osgeo.org#How_to_get_in_contact_via_mailing_lists))

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/resources/flyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

- Ok,
[OSGeo](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo)is involved in working with maps and things, but what kind of projects does it really do? Have a look at the[live blog feed](http://planet.osgeo.org/)to see what people are working on right now.

- Mentors, there's an additional link providing some tips and specifying your responsibilities on the main OSGeo
[Google Summer of Code 2015](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2015)wiki page.

## The ideas pages

**[Check back often, it's a work in progress]**


Each participating project's list of ideas is on the respective projects' wikis, with a short description of the project and what type of students would be interested in it:

### OSGeo Foundation member projects

*More coming soon: Get started talking to your favorite project's development team today!*



:**GRASS GIS**SoC Ideas[GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org)is an open source GIS focusing on analysis, modeling and visualization. It is a collection of modules written in C and Python and has a GUI written in wxPython. If you know Python, or want to implement algorithms in C, take a look!

:**GDAL**Ideas[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org)is a C++ library for reading and writing geospatial data raster and vector formats.



: gvSIG is a free GIS project for**gvSIG**Ideas[Desktop](http://www.gvsig.com/en/web/guest/products/gvsig-desktop). The gvSIG project looks for students with Java or Python skills that want to develop new ideas on this software.



:**Opticks**Ideas[Opticks](http://opticks.org/)is an extensible[remote sensing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing)and imagery analysis desktop application. It provides a framework to process remote sensing data such as[Hyperspectral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging)(HSI),[Multispectral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-spectral_image)(MSI), and[Synthetic aperture radar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_radar)(SAR) imagery and video. The application is written in C++ and licensed under LGPL v2.1. Extensions are written using C++ or Python. You can review the[available extensions](http://opticks.org/confluence/display/opticksExt/All+Opticks+Extensions)and[feature tour](http://opticks.org/confluence/display/opticks/Feature+Tour+-+Your+Data)to get a better idea of what Opticks can do.



:**OTB**SoC Ideas[ORFEO ToolBox](http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org)(OTB) is an open source library for remote sensing image processing.Targeted algorithms for high resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available. The software has been under active development since 2006 and is written in C++ and it includes also side projects also open source with GUI like Monteverdi. OTB has recently started the incubation process into OSGeo.



: MapServer is a Web Mapping Engine; an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web.**Mapserver**SoC Ideas



:**istSOS**Ideas[istSOS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/istsos/)(Istituto Scienze della Terra Sensor Observation Service) is an implementation of the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The development of istSOS was started in 2009 in order to provide a simple implementation of the SOS standard for the management, provision and integration of hydro-meteorological data collected in Canton Ticino (Switzerland). istSOS is entirely written in Python.



[GSOC Ideas](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/wiki/GSOC-Ideas):is a web server that allows you to serve maps and data from a variety of formats to standard clients such as web browsers and desktop GIS applications. GeoServer works with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), Web Processing Service (WPS) and Web Map Service (WMS) standards.**GeoServer**

- The GeoServer team asks applicants to introduce themselves on the geoserver-devel list ( Communicating in public is a key success factor to open source development )




:*GSOC*GeoTools is an open source Java library for working with geospatial data, including both data access, data structures, processing and a powerful rendering engine. GeoTools is a modular library used in a wide range of web service, command line tools and desktop applications.**GeoTools**



: ZOO-Project is a WPS (Web Processing Service) open source project released under MIT/X-11 style license. It provides an OGC WPS compliant developer-friendly framework to create and chain WPS Web services.**ZOO-Project**Soc Ideas





:**Osgeo-Live**SoC Ideas[OSGeo-Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html)is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around. It provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data. It also contains sample datasets and documentation.
