# OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2010

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation would like to extend a welcome to all SoC students. On this page you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you, and serve as example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcomed - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open source leaders; show us what you've got.

**If you need more information on how to apply you can contact all the mentoring organisations via soc at lists.osgeo.org**

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/GsocFlyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

# What to expect during the summer?

## Be prepared to be in constant communication with your mentors and project

You and your mentors will decide on the specifics, but we will expect you and your mentor to communicate *a lot*. Part of the idea of SoC is to intergrate you into the developer community, so you should get involved from the start. The more you communicate the easier it will be. Don't be afraid that the mentors will request your phone number. It is only to make sure that we can reach you, in case of problems.

## Weekly reports

Yes, every week we expect to see a report posted to the soc@osgeo mailing list that at least answers the following questions:

- What did you get done this week?
- What do you plan on doing next week?
- Are you blocked on anything?

These questions BTW are the same as are used in real-work, when developing with the
[Scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)) [development process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). ;)

If you want, feel free to write *more*. But three sentences is the bare minimum. *IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SEND YOUR PROGRESS REPORTS ON TIME*, if you don't send this email your mentors will start to get twitchy, and *especially* if they don't get any responses to their emails / don't see you in IRC. Twitchy mentors is not what we want. If you are blocked by finals, that's cool. We have all studied at some point, just tell us about it, be honest. If you don't know how to proceed and your mentor isn't answering *definitely* tell about it. The SoC project admins will always be available. Basically the point is that you open up the communication channels, and keep them open. That way you will have a super summer, and get paid ;)

Last year this weekly report proved to be very popular among the students and mentors alike, so we will keep it up.

## Wiki page and blogs

In addition to weekly reports we ask you to maintain a wiki or blog page for your project. You should store your weekly reports there and add other information, like how to compile and test your program. If applicable add screenshots and other nice info.

Wiki and/or blog space can and will be provided by OSGeo if your project doesn't have anything already set up for this.

# Timeline

# The ideas pages

Each participating project's list of ideas is here, with a short description of the project and what type of students would be interested in it:

[GDAL SoC Ideas](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SummerOfCode): GDAL is the Geographic Data Abstraction Library, a library which provides access to spatial data in all kinds of formats via a uniform API.[GRASS SoC Ideas](http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_SoC_Ideas): GRASS GIS is an open source GIS focusing mainly on analysis. It is written as a collection of stand-alone C programs and has a new GUI written in Python. If you know Python, or want to implement algorithms in C take a look![Mapbender SoC ideas 2010](http://www.mapbender.org/GSoC_2010): Mapbender is a server and client side geographic data management tool, programmed in**PHP**and**JavaScript**, using the**jQuery**library.[Quantum GIS SoC Ideas](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2010)Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows. QGIS supports vector, raster, and database formats.[uDig Summer of Code](http://udig.refractions.net/confluence/display/HACK/Summer+of+Code): User-friendly Desktop GIS is a Java application written with the Eclipse RCP framework. The project has a community svn area to host student plug-ins, tutorials cover how to package up a custom application to show off your work.[OpenJUMP/deegree Ideas List](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jump-pilot/index.php?title=OpenJUMP_Google_Summer_Of_Code): deegree and OpenJUMP share code derived from the original JUMP. Both programs maintain separate development lists and source code repositories but look for opportunities to collaborate.[OpenRouter 2010 SOC Ideas](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OpenRouter_2010_SOC_Ideas): OpenRouter is a couple of projects that are building routing and driving direction libraries and applications that can be integrated with other applications.- OSSIM
[Py-OSSIM](http://web.me.com/epiesasha/PlanetSasha/2010Project.html): - ossim-swig-python to generate code to call ossim from python [Cartographic Engine project ideas built on Mapnik](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Cartographic_Engine#Ideas_for_Summer_of_Code_2010_Project): Refining much needed high quality hardcopy output tools that encourage collaboration. Built on Mapnik, applications like QGIS, GRASS, MapServer, etc. can output using these features. Focused initially on building specs that support Mapnik as the engine, but that could be applied generally across OSGeo projects as well.[Spatialytics.org GSoC 2010 Ideas](http://www.spatialytics.org/google-summer-of-code-2010-ideas/): Spatialytics.org is the new home of the three open source Geospatial BI projects (GeoKettle, GeoMondrian and SOLAPLayers). Geospatial Business Intelligence (BI) tools, such as spatial ETL (Extract, Transform and Load), geo-analytical dashboards and Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) allow decision-makers to rapidly analyze large amount of data at different levels of time, geography and detail in order to make better decisions.[MapWindow GIS SoC Ideas](http://www.mapwindow.org/wiki/index.php/Google_Summer_of_Code): MapWindow is a free, extensible, geographic information system (GIS) that can be used as an alternative desktop GIS, to distribute data to others, to develop and distribute custom spatial data analyses, written in .NET (C++, C#, VB.NET). If you're a talented VB.Net, C#, or C++ programmer, you could be the perfect fit to work on this project. We have a couple of ideas that could be done over the summer; feel free to suggest your own ideas or plug-ins as well.[MapServer GSoC Ideas](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/MapServer_2010_SOC_Ideas): MapServer is a Web Mapping Engine; an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web.[OSGeo Live](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Live_GIS_Disc_GSoC_2010)is a stack of 35+ of the best GeoSpatial Open Source packages bundled as a LiveDVD and Virtual Machine on top an Xubuntu linux ditribution.
