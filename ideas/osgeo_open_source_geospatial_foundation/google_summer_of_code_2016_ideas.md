## OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2016

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org) would like to extend a welcome to all SoC students. On this page you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you, and serve as example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcomed - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open source leaders; show us what you've got.

**Students: check out the**([Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students)page. If you need more information on how to apply you can contact all the mentors via the OSGeo-SoC mailing list[see below](https://wiki.osgeo.org#How_to_get_in_contact_via_mailing_lists))

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/resources/flyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

- Ok,
[OSGeo](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo)is involved in working with maps and things, but what kind of projects does it really do? Have a look at the[live blog feed](http://planet.osgeo.org/)to see what people are working on right now.

- Mentors, there's an additional link providing some tips and specifying your responsibilities on the main OSGeo
[Google_Summer_of_Code_2016_Administrative](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2016_Administrative)wiki page.

## The ideas pages

**[Check back often, it's a work in progress]**


Each participating project's list of ideas is on the respective projects' wikis, with a short description of the project and what type of students would be interested in it:

### OSGeo Foundation member projects

*More coming soon: Get started talking to your favorite project's development team today!*



:**GRASS GIS**SoC Ideas[GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org)is an open source GIS focusing on analysis, modeling and visualization. It is a collection of modules written in C and Python and has a GUI written in wxPython. If you know Python, or want to implement algorithms in C, take a look!



:**QGIS**SoC Ideas[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org)is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows. QGIS supports vector, raster, and database formats. It is written in C++ and Python.



:**GDAL**Ideas[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org)is a C++ library for reading and writing geospatial data raster and vector formats.



: gvSIG is a free GIS project for**gvSIG**Ideas[Desktop](http://www.gvsig.com/en/web/guest/products/gvsig-desktop). The gvSIG project looks for students with Java or Python skills that want to develop new ideas on this software.



:**istSOS**Ideas[istSOS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/istsos/)is a complete sensor data management system for acquiring, storing and dispatching time-series observations. istSOS is compliant with the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) version 1.0 and 2.0 standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and offers unique extended capabilities to support scientific data analyses (integrated quality assurance, RESTful API, on the fly processing with virtual procedures, remote data aggregation and time-space re-projection etc.). istSOS core libraries are written in Python while it easy to use interface is Web based.



:**ZOO-Project**Ideas[ZOO-Project](http://www.zoo-project.org)is a WPS open source project released under a MIT/X-11 style license. It provides support for WPS 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 versions and is able to handle services implemented in various programming languages.



:**Osgeo-Live**SoC Ideas[OSGeo-Live](http://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html)is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed around. It provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of data. It also contains sample datasets and documentation.

### Guest projects

Like-minded geospatial projects to take part under OSGeo umbrella. If you wish your software project to be listed here, please contact [Madi](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/User:Madi) or Anne.



:**pgRouting**Ideas[pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org)extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality and more.



:**PyWPS**Ideas[PyWPS](http://pywps.wald.intevation.org)is server implementation of OGC WPS standard on server side using Python programming language. Currently,[new version of PyWPS](http://github.com/jachym/pywps-4/)is being done, were we would like to implement several new attractive features.



: The JGrasstools project is a geospatial modules library dedicated to environment model in the fields of hydrology, geomorphology and forestry. JGrassTools also contains section for data handling (raster, vector and LiDAR point cloud) and mobile connection.**JGrasstools**SoC Ideas



: The**OneBusAway**Ideas[OneBusAway](http://onebusaway.org/)open source project is a consortium of representatives from public sector transit agencies, commercial firms, academic research representatives, and interested individuals, aiming at delivering robust real-time applications that meet the needs of transit providers and academic researchers.

### See also

Other like minded projects do not participate to GSoC under OSGeo umbrella, but with their own organization. You may want to visit also their page:



:**OpenStreetMap**Ideas[OSM](http://osm.org/)is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.



### Don't see in the list the project you're interested in?

Contact them in their developers mailing list! Feel free to propose your own idea and get feedback!

## I want to apply as a student

Before applying as a student, check out the [Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students) page.



### Which project do I choose?

Most of the software projects are available pre-built on our Live demo { DVD | USB stick | VirtualMachine } with project overviews and short tutorials where you can try everything out.
