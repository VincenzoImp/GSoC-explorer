## OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2018

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org) would like to extend a welcome to all SoC students. On this page you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you, and serve as example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcomed - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open source leaders and the future of the geospatial industry; show us what you've got!

**Students: check out the**([Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_Recommendations_for_Students)page. If you need more information on how to apply you can contact all the mentors via the OSGeo-SoC mailing list[see below](https://wiki.osgeo.org#How_to_get_in_contact_via_mailing_lists)) And look at[GSoC Roles and Responsibilities](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities)to understand a successfull teamwork and interplay of project, mentors and students.

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/resources/flyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

- Ok,
[OSGeo](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo)is involved in working with maps and things, but what kind of projects does it really do? Have a look at the[live blog feed](http://planet.osgeo.org/)to see what people are working on right now.

- Mentors, there's an additional link providing some tips and specifying your responsibilities on the main OSGeo
[Google Summer of Code 2018 Administrative](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2018_Administrative)wiki page.

## The ideas pages

**[Check back often, it's a work in progress]**

To add your page, **please contact the GSoC admin team** to let them know of your ideas page, by sending an email to [gsoc-admin@osgeo.org](mailto:gsoc-admin@osgeo.org)

*More coming soon: Get started talking to your favorite project's development team today!*

Each participating project's list of ideas is on the respective projects' wikis, with a short description of the project and what type of students would be interested in it:

### OSGeo Foundation graduated projects

:**GRASS GIS**SoC Ideas[GRASS GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org)is an open source GIS focusing on analysis, modeling and visualization. It is a collection of modules written in C and Python and has a GUI written in wxPython. If you know Python, or want to implement algorithms in C, take a look!



: gvSIG is a free GIS project for**gvSIG**Ideas[Desktop](http://www.gvsig.com/en/web/guest/products/gvsig-desktop). The gvSIG project looks for students with Java or Python skills that want to develop new ideas on this software.



:**PostGIS**Ideas[PostGIS](http://postgis.net)spatially enables the popular PostgreSQL object-relational database, allowing it to be used as a back-end database for geographic information systems (GIS) and web-mapping applications.



### OSGeo Foundation Incubation projects

:**istSOS**Ideas[istSOS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/istsos/)is a complete sensor data management system for acquiring, storing and dispatching time-series observations. istSOS is compliant with the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) version 1.0 and 2.0 standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and offers unique extended capabilities to support scientific data analyses (integrated quality assurance, RESTful API, on the fly processing with virtual procedures, remote data aggregation and time-space re-projection etc.). istSOS core libraries are written in Python while it easy to use interface is Web based.



:**PyWPS**Ideas[PyWPS](http://pywps.org/)is an implementation of the Web Processing Service standard from the Open Geospatial Consortium. PyWPS is written in Python. PyWPS enables integration, publishing and execution of Python processes via the WPS standard.



:**ZOO-Project**Ideas[ZOO-Project](http://www.zoo-project.org)is a WPS open source project released under a MIT/X-11 style license. It provides support for WPS 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 versions and is able to handle services implemented in various programming languages.

### OSGeo Foundation community projects

:**pgRouting**Ideas[pgRouting](http://pgrouting.org)extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality and more.



### Guest projects

Like-minded geospatial projects to take part under OSGeo umbrella. If you wish your software project to be listed here, please contact the GSoC admin team, by sending an email to [gsoc-admin@osgeo.org](mailto:gsoc-admin@osgeo.org)

Ideas:**NASA-ESA Web World Wind**[NASA-ESA Web World Wind](https://webworldwind.org/)is a 3D virtual globe API for HTML5 and JavaScript.
