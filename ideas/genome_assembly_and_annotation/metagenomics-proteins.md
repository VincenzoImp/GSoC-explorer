### MGnify Protein Database

#### The MGnify Protein Database is searchable by accession or sequence

Protein sequences are derived from the analysis of publicly available metagenomics assemblies within MGnify using our combined gene caller (which uses both Prodigal and FragGeneScan). Each sequence is assigned an MGYP accession. MGYPs are non-redundant, meaning that proteins with exactly the same sequence are assigned the same MGYP identifier.
