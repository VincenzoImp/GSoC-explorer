🌸 Have questions about the organization or the projects? Check out the [GSoC 2026 Discourse thread](https://discourse.processing.org/t/updates-about-gsoc-2026-org-application-in-progress/47450)! 🌸

🌼 We're keeping the [ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](https://github.com/processing/Processing-Foundation-GSoC/wiki/FAQs) resource up-to-date with questions people have been asking, so if the thread is a bit too much to read through, start with the FAQs! 🌼

Until February 3, 2026. we will be applying as an org. First, the org has to be accepted; then, the applications for contributors will open. For now, contributor applications are not open. [Stay tuned on Discourse!](https://discourse.processing.org/t/updates-about-gsoc-2026-org-application-in-progress/47450)

For more information, read the [Google Summer of Code FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

The Processing Foundation has participated in GSoC 13 times since 2011. We recommend you review some of these reports to gain valuable insights in the kind of projects we support. This will help you craft more effective proposals for this year's GSoC at the Processing Foundation.

Using LLM-based generative AI tools like ChatGPT can enhance your writing by refining language and structure. However, the knowledge, ideas, and reasoning in your proposal must originate from *you*. AI serves as a support tool, not a substitute for human creativity. Proposals generated entirely by AI will not be considered. We value your originality and problem understanding. Any proposal submitted using AI tools should clearly indicate what part is your work and what part was enhanced or generated by AI.
