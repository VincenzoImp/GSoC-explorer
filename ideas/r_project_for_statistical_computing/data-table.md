# data.table

[13 revisions](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2026/wiki/data.table/_history)

The [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) package is an invaluable tool for data analysis and manipulation.

data.table is one of the most widely used R packages.

Find one or more students to fix/close some of the hundreds of
outstanding [issues](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues).

Maybe would be good to start with the [issues labeled as beginner-task](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner-task).

It would be easier for me if a student approached and said something like :

- “I want to do some serious C at low level”. I could then propose something there.
- “I want to write documentation/vignette/whitepaper”. Then I could suggest writing about data.table code that hasn’t been written about before.
- “I want to close 100 issues, one per day”. Then maybe I could pick the ones where that might be possible.
- “I want to work on performance testing/ using atime for benchmarking”. I will teach on how to use atime to check if reported data.table issues have been fixed. Look at
[atime issues](https://github.com/tdhock/atime/issues)for a list of ideas.

Test is to find an [issue labeled as beginner-task](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner-task),

- try to reproduce on your own computer, and report your results on the issue (were you able to reproduce? or not?)
- create a PR which would close that issue.

When you have finished at least one test, please add a link to it on this page, then contact the following mentors:

- Toby Dylan Hocking @tdhock
- Anirban Chetia @Anirban166
- Doris Amoakohene @DorisAmoakohene
- Joshua Wu @joshhwuu

IMPORTANT: please avoid using AI code generation tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc) for this project.
[Please read contributor guidelines](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table?tab=contributing-ov-file#pull-requests-prs).
If your test results seem to be AI-generated, then you will probably not be selected as a contributor for this project.
