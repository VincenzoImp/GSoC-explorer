## Mailinglists

There are two mailing lists used by this project. Here’s a description and instructions

for each.

### libssh@libssh.org

There is a general discussion mailing list where you can discuss this project, ask for help, announce patches, and anything else that could possibly be talked about with the developers of libssh.

To join the list, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh+subscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh+subscribe@libssh.org)

To subscribe to the “nomail” version of this list send a blank message to

[libssh+subscribe-nomail@libssh.org](mailto:libssh+subscribe-nomail@libssh.org)

The nomail version of a list means that you are recognized as a subscriber, but will not get any messages to the list. This is useful when it’s necessary to post from several email addresses to a subscribers only list.

To send an e-mail to the list, address it to

[libssh@libssh.org](mailto:libssh@libssh.org)

To unsubscribe, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh+unsubscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh+unsubscribe@libssh.org)

For more help, send a blank email to

[libssh+help@libssh.org](mailto:libssh+help@libssh.org)

All of the above information plus more will be sent to you.

### libssh-commits@libssh.org

There is also this read-only mailing list which tracks changes to the GIT tree. You’ll be sent an email each time someone commits a change. This is not normally a high-volume list, but it certainly can be at times.

To join the list, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh-commits+subscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh-commits+subscribe@libssh.org)

To unsubscribe, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh-commits+unsubscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh-commits+unsubscribe@libssh.org)

### libssh-tickets@libssh.org

This is a read-only mailing list which tracks all ticket changes of the trac system. You’ll be sent an email each time someone creates, comments or modifies a ticket. This isn’t a high-volume list, but it certainly can be at times.

To join the list, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh-tickets+subscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh-tickets+subscribe@libssh.org)

To unsubscribe, send a blank e-mail to

[libssh-tickets+unsubscribe@libssh.org](mailto:libssh-tickets+unsubscribe@libssh.org)
