# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026 - Neutralinojs

GSoC 2026 ideas and guidelines - Neutralinojs

## What is GSoC?

GSoC (Google Summer of Code) is an international program that motivates developers to contribute to open-source projects. Google awards stipends for contributors who
successfully complete the GSoC program. GSoC contributors typically work on open-source development tasks under the guidance of organization mentors. Read more details about GSoC from the [official website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).

## How do you become a GSoC contributor?

Anyone (including beginners and students) older than 18 can contribute to the GSoC program. Check more details about contributor eligibility from [this link](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules).

Follow these steps to get started with GSoC 2026 as a contributor:

1. Understand Neutralinojs as a user (app developer) using the [official website](https://neutralino.js.org).
2. Create a sample Neutralinojs app using several native API functions.
3. Join the Neutralinojs Discord channel using [this invitation link](https://discord.gg/cybpp4guTJ).
4. Introduce yourself in the #gsoc channel on Discord and post the GitHub link of your sample app.
5. Become familiar with the main project and sub-projects, start with the [documentation](https://neutralino.js.org/docs), and then, with primary[codebases](https://github.com/neutralinojs).
6. Watch [framework](https://youtu.be/QGZywYDsSyg), [JavaScript API](https://youtu.be/V-RD6ia5YjY), and [CLI](https://youtu.be/XUj20aJDJiI) code explanation videos for detailed codebase explanations. 
7. Read both [contribution guide](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/contributing/framework-developer-guide) and [code style guide](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/contributing/code-style-guide), then start contributing (our recommendation is to start contributing to documentation first to master the Neutralinojs framework as a user).
8. Tell us about tasks that you would like to work on. If you have new ideas, mention them in community channels with your project goals.
9. Start drafting a proposal by discussing it with mentors.
10. Submit your proposal and achieve the planned milestones based on the GSoC program [schedule](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2026).

## Contribution guide

Mastering a codebase takes time, even if you are experienced in the languages and tools used within the specific codebase. Neutralinojs codebases use several unique techniques, practices, and standards to implement simple solutions for complex problems &mdash; understanding them properly takes time. So, we recommend you get started by making small but high-quality contributions like small bug fixes, code improvements, and small features first, without trying to implement entire APIs or large features that require several discussions. Also, make sure not to implement solutions for existing GSoC ideas during the contribution period, since our goal is to build well-designed solutions for them collaboratively during the actual GSoC coding period based on approved GSoC proposals. 

Learning, experimenting, collaborating, and gradually starting contributions creates a good first impression with your high-quality work. 

We really appreciate your code contributions. Please read [this contribution guide](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/contributing/framework-developer-guide#contribution-guidelines) before sending a pull request. Thank you for your contributions.

## Using AI-powered programming tools during GSoC

We don't discourage using AI-powered programming tools. If you prefer, you can use AI tools during code contributions, but make sure to carefully review AI-generated code snippets manually before submitting them in pull requests for review. However, we strongly recommend avoiding the following activities with AI:

- Don't automate the whole programming task with AI &mdash; code productivity with AI-powered suggestions instead
- Don't generate verbose, artificial pull request descriptions with AI &mdash; write a concise message yourself
- Don't ask design decisions from AI agents &mdash; study the codebase yourself

The GSoC program is an opportunity for you to learn, explore, experiment, and build, so use AI only for your coding productivity, not to automate everything you are responsible for.

## How do you start writing a project proposal?

1. Make sure to follow the above initial steps and become familiar with the project.
2. Select a project idea from the ones mentioned below
3. If you have an idea of your own / want to initiate one, post its summary and goals in a [new GitHub discussion thread](https://github.com/neutralinojs/gsoc2026/discussions/new?category=ideas).
4. Wait until project maintainers give feedback on the post (We can identify possible changes in the early stage).
5. Start drafting your proposal based on the Neutralinojs GSoC contributor proposal outline.

## What is the project proposal template?

Please create your GSoC proposal according to the following outline:

1. Contact details (Name, Country, Email, GitHub username, Discord username, and a small description about yourself)
2. Neutralinojs experience (Explain your familiarity with Neutralinojs)4
3. Contributions (Add links to your pull requests, issues, and discussion threads)
4.  Project description (Describe the project idea)
5.  Goals (Summary of deliverables)
6.  Tasks Timeline (Divide your goals into tasks and map them with the GSoC timeline)
7.  Future contributions (How do you plan to contribute to Neutralinojs in the future?)
