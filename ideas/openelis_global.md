Project Name | Project Size | Project Description | Expected Out Come | Required Skills | Selected Contributor | Mentors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Creating a generic robust reporting framework
| 350 hours | OpenELIS already has support for pre-designed reports. This project aims to create a Robust reporting framework for users to be able to create ad-hoc Patient reports from the UI | Ability to create ad-hoc Patient reports from the UI | React , Typescript, Java , Spring , REST |
| Mutesasira Moses |
Improve Integration Tests coverage
| 350 hours | The current Integration Test This project aims at extending and creating more Integration Tests to achieve a Test Coverage of at least 60% for the Backend Service and Controller Layer | 60% Test coverage | Java , Spring , J-Unit |

Create a Comprehensive FHIR facade Layer For OpenELIS Global | 350 Hours | OpenELIS currrently implements FHIR through interacting with a parallel HAPI FHIR JPA server. However this creates a challenge of prfectly syncying a separate server with the OpenELIS database. | A working FHIR facade for OpenELIS that supports FHIR transaction for FHIR Resources currenly implemented in OpenELIS | Java , Spring , FHIR , REST |
| Reagan Makoba |
Modernizing the OpenELIS React Frontend with TypeScript and Performance Optimization | 350 Hours | The current React frontend is mainly JavaScript and struggles with performance as data grows. This project will improve performance, maintainability, and reliability by migrating to TypeScript and applying modern React performance best practices. | The work will include incremental TypeScript adoption, improved state and server-state management, component refactoring, and performance optimizations such as memoization, query caching, and bundle size reduction. | JavaScript , REST , TypeScript |
| Samwel Male @Male Samuel |
Security Audit and Hardening of the OpenELIS Laboratory Information System | 350 Hours | This project aims to conduct a comprehensive security audit of OpenELIS to identify vulnerabilities, risks, and potential attack surfaces across its architecture and dependencies. The work will include threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, and risk prioritization, followed by recommendations and targeted fixes where feasible. The project will establish a strong security baseline for OpenELIS, improving trust, supporting compliance with healthcare data protection standards, and ensuring long-term maintainability for the open-source community. |
**Comprehensive Security Audit Report**detailing threat models, identified vulnerabilities, risk severity, and recommended mitigations**Automated Security Testing Assets**, including static analysis, dependency vulnerability scanning, and CI/CD-integrated security checks**Targeted Security Fixes**addressing high-risk vulnerabilities through patches or pull requests**Security Documentation**outlining secure deployment guidelines and coding best practices for OpenELIS contributors**Improved Security Awareness**within the OpenELIS community through actionable findings and recommendations
