I’d like to express my gratitude for the ## Search BarCurrently, navigating the documentation can be challenging when searching for specific rules or keywords. Adding a smart search bar with the following features could make a significant difference : **Suggestions:**Provide real-time suggestions as users type, helping them quickly locate what they’re looking for.**Keywords :**Highlight relevant keywords in the search results.**Optional filters :**To add more precision to find something.**Results:**Organize search results into categories (e.g., Rules, Configurations, Examples).
FYI, Im fullstack developer with great experience in frontend web application or static websites. The suggestion is open to further details or refinements. |
