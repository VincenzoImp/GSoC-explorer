## Test Development in C/C++: Implementing event-driven concurrency in OLTP test tool (dbt5)

### Project Description

This project is a learning exercise in developing event-driven code by converting a thread-based concurrency model in a C++ application to use an event-driven model. DBT-5 is the application that is an open source implementation of the TPC Benchmark(TM) E Specification. This specification is an OLTP workload modeling a brokerage house. DBT-5 is currently using a thread (pthreads) based model in several programs and we want to convert that to a concurrency model that has shown itself to be significantly less resource intensive.

The general outline of the project, which can be adapted depending on the contributor's skill level:

- Learn how to program a simple event-driven program using libev
- Learn how to use DBT-5 to run a small scale test against PostgreSQL
- Replace the threaded model in the DBT-5, one program at a time

## Implement AI copilot for pgwatch

### Project Description

This project proposes building a standalone, CLI-based AI copilot for PostgreSQL monitoring, designed to work with metrics collected by pgwatch.

pgwatch is a mature, PostgreSQL-specific monitoring system that stores a rich set of performance metrics and statistics. However, analyzing these metrics during incidents still requires significant manual effort: navigating dashboards, correlating multiple data sources, and relying on expert knowledge.

The goal of this project is to allow engineers to use pgwatch and analyze its metrics using natural language prompts.

## pg_ai_query: Improving AI Query Generation Accuracy and Configuration

### Project Description

pg_ai_query is a PostgreSQL extension that generates SQL queries from natural language using AI models. While functional, production usage reveals that LLMs frequently hallucinate PostgreSQL syntax generating non-existent functions or version-incompatible queries.

This project aims to dramatically improve query accuracy by integrating real-time PostgreSQL documentation context (e.g., Context7 MCP), and to solve configuration challenges where PostgreSQL extensions cannot access environment variables or secrets managers.

Students will design and implement an architecture that decouples AI logic from the extension, enabling accurate, version-aware query generation with flexible configuration.

### Skills needed

- C (PostgreSQL extension development, SPI)
- Python/Go/Rust (optional)
- HTTP/REST API integration
- Basic understanding of LLM behavior

### Difficulty level

Moderate

### Project size

Medium

### Mentors

- Sachin Beniwal <sachinbeniwal0101 (at) gmail (dot) com>
- Arth Thapa <probablyarth (at) gmail (dot) com>

### Expected outcomes

- Measurable improvement in query generation accuracy
- Flexible configuration support (environment variables, secrets)
- Decoupled architecture enabling independent updates and testing
- Documentation and test suite

## Join Removal Based on Foreign Key Constraints

### Project Description

The project focuses on adding the ability to remove joins to tables when the join is on a foreign key column and only the child table columns are needed in the query result.

This is a common optimization in enterprise databases (Oracle, DB2) that PostgreSQL currently lacks. When a view joins multiple tables but a query only needs columns from some of them, the optimizer should be able to eliminate unnecessary joins if foreign key constraints guarantee referential integrity.

Example scenario:

-- View joining orders to customers CREATE VIEW order_summary AS SELECT o.* FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id; -- Query only uses order columns - join should be eliminated SELECT order_id, amount FROM order_summary;

The optimizer should recognize that the join to customers table is unnecessary since:

- Only columns from orders are selected
- The foreign key constraint guarantees the join will succeed
- No filtering on customers columns exists

### Skills needed

- C programming
- SQL
- PostgreSQL

### Difficulty level

Hard

### Project size

Large: approximately ~350 hours of work.

### Mentors

- Nik Samokhvalov <nik (at) postgres (dot) ai>

### Expected outcomes

- A working implementation of FK-based join elimination in the query optimizer
- Updated cost estimation to account for eliminated joins
- Comprehensive regression tests covering various join patterns
- Documentation outlining the optimization rules and limitations
- Performance benchmarks demonstrating query speedups

## B-tree Index Bloat Reduction (Page Merge)

### Project Description

The project focuses on implementing efficient B-tree index bloat reduction through page merging. B-tree indexes can become severely bloated after heavy UPDATE/DELETE workloads - in production systems, indexes with 90%+ bloat are common.

Current solutions have significant drawbacks:

**REINDEX**: Requires AccessExclusiveLock for entire duration (blocks all access)**REINDEX CONCURRENTLY**: Very long duration, requires 2x disk space**pg_repack**: External tool, complex setup, requires double space

This project would implement in-core page merging that:

- Merges sparsely populated leaf pages with their neighbors
- Uses two-phase locking (light lock for planning, brief exclusive lock for execution)
- Provides crash safety through WAL logging
- Achieves 30-50% bloat reduction with minimal disruption

A prototype extension (pg_btree_compact) has been developed demonstrating the approach. This project would work toward integrating similar functionality into core PostgreSQL, potentially as part of VACUUM or as a new REINDEX variant.

### Skills needed

- C programming
- PostgreSQL
- B-Tree structures

### Difficulty level

Hard

### Project size

Large: approximately ~350 hours of work.

### Mentors

- Kirk Wolak <wolakk (at) gmail (dot) com>
- Nik Samokhvalov <nik (at) postgres (dot) ai>
- Andrei Lepikhov <lepihov (at) gmail (dot) com>

### Expected outcomes

- Working implementation of B-tree page merging
- Integration with VACUUM or as standalone command
- Proper WAL logging for crash safety
- Minimal exclusive lock duration (<1ms per 100 page merges)
- Performance benchmarks and bloat reduction measurements
- Comprehensive tests using amcheck for index integrity verification

## Monitoring Tools Performance: pg_stat_statements and LWLock Contention

### Project Description

The project focuses on improving the performance and reducing lock contention in PostgreSQL's monitoring infrastructure, particularly pg_stat_statements and related statistics collectors. Keeping in mind that the more executing backends you have running queries need to lock this structure for writing. Then monitoring software needs to lock this structure for reading. The faster the system, the more locking/unlocking takes up most of the time. Also, as the number of statements being tracked increases, the reading takes longer. Finally, sampling could reduce some of this.

pg_stat_statements is essential for query performance analysis, but it has known scalability issues:

**Lock contention**: High-frequency queries cause contention on the shared hash table**Memory pressure**: Limited entries (default 5000) cause eviction churn on busy systems**Reset overhead**: pg_stat_statements_reset() can cause significant pauses

Similar issues affect other monitoring tools:

- pg_stat_activity updates
- pg_stat_user_tables/indexes statistics
- Custom statistics collectors

Goals of this project:

- Analyze and profile current lock contention patterns
- Implement lock-free or reduced-lock data structures where possible
- Add partitioned/sharded hash tables for better scalability
- Consider/test ideas on timing out (and not logging) if having to wait too long for the lock
- Consider/test a secondary queue for things to add when we have time
- Consider/test a circular buffer so reading always returns the previous portion of the buffer w/o locking
- Improve statistics aggregation efficiency
- Reduce impact on production workloads

This work is critical for observability in high-throughput PostgreSQL deployments where monitoring overhead must be minimized.

### Skills needed

- C programming
- Performance profiling
- Concurrency/locking patterns
- PostgreSQL

### Expected outcomes

- Measurable reduction in lock contention for pg_stat_statements
- Improved scalability under high query rates (target: 100k+ queries/sec)
- Benchmarks comparing before/after performance
- Documentation of new architecture and trade-offs
- Regression tests ensuring correctness of statistics collection

## Wait Event Coverage Improvements

### Project Description

The project focuses on improving PostgreSQL's wait event coverage to provide more accurate observability into what the database is doing at any given moment. More importantly, what the database is waiting on. While PostgreSQL has many waits being properly recorded, this project is designed to find as many places as possible where we wait, and we should clarify what we are waiting on/for. This project will add the code required to track those new wait areas properly.

Many monitoring tools that implement wait event analysis (AWS RDS Performance Insights, pgsentinel, pg_wait_sampling, and others) visualize samples where "wait_event IS NULL" as "CPU" time, typically shown in green. This convention originated from Oracle and has become widespread.

However, this assumption can make analysis inaccurate because there are many places in PostgreSQL code that are not covered by wait events but technically should be - and such places cannot accurately be labeled as "CPU". When a backend shows NULL wait_event, it might be:

- Actually doing CPU work (legitimate)
- Performing I/O that isn't instrumented
- Waiting on internal synchronization not covered by wait events
- Executing extension code without proper instrumentation

This project would:

- Systematically analyze PostgreSQL source code to identify non-instrumented waits
- Categorize gaps by type (I/O, synchronization, extension hooks, etc.)
- Propose and implement new wait events for significant gaps
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing monitoring tools
- Document the new wait events and their meanings

Initial analysis has identified potential gaps in areas like:

- Some file I/O operations
- Internal memory allocation paths
- Extension hook execution
- Background worker coordination
- Certain replication scenarios

### Skills needed

- C programming
- PostgreSQL
- Basic understanding of performance analysis

### Difficulty level

Moderate

### Project size

Large: approximately ~350 hours of work.

### Mentors

- Nik Samokhvalov <nik (at) postgres (dot) ai>
- Kirk Wolak <wolakk (at) gmail (dot) com>
- Andreas Karlsson <andreas (at) proxel (dot) se>

### Expected outcomes

- Comprehensive analysis of current wait event coverage gaps
- Implementation of new wait events for significant uninstrumented code paths
- Improved accuracy of "CPU" vs "waiting" distinction in monitoring tools
- Documentation of all new wait events
- Regression tests ensuring wait events fire correctly
- Backward compatibility with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Getting and applying feedback (especially on naming) from the Hackers group
