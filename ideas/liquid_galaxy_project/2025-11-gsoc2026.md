**Thank you to all 11 contributors**who have made an entry on time. We hope you learn a lot from this experience, and hopefully, nobody knows till later on Feb 19, some of you get a GSoC.



**Stats on preliminary tasks as Feb 7**



More than 50 are working hard to do those on time and well,


*Thank you for your time and efforts, and good luck for Feb 19th.*




**The Liquid Galaxy project has been presented to Google for Google Summer of Code 2026.**

**Now Google will select which organizations are in this year, and we all, contributors and organizations,**

**will know**

**on February 19.**

**So good luck for all, and don't stop working on your preliminary tasks.**







### Project Ideas

[Google Sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhdtQ6PZoqbwHIFDoXDMfu4MW_-dYfnBqvpDGbRV1KU/edit?usp=sharing)

**To keep it clear: all the documents have the same proposals, only the NotebookLM-powered ones have amazing graphics that catch the point about the spectacularity of a visualization from Liquid Galaxy has.**

**Anyway, we recommend you browse first the slides, and when you have an idea of the project (Google allows you to present a maximum of three), look at the plain definition of the same idea in the Google Sheet.**

[AI Clarification Policy note,](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2025/11/GSoC2026.html#ai)but implementing a self-review code process, as the Artificial Intelligence wave makes us all to work harder to detect fake work and bad non-maintainable code. Always next the guidance and supervision of your mentor and admins.

[Task 5](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2025/11/GSoC2026.html#task5), which can be done by anyone, at anytime, but with the rules already written in the post. If you have any doubt, as always, contact us on Discord if the question is open, or by email if it's private.

**We're here to help you.**

**Get inspiration from the live streaming we have with Harsh, from VIT Pune, and mentors Yash, Vedant and andreu admin**

**about the opening of our new LAB in India, and activities with our project.**

1st dateline: JAN 11 2026, Task 1 statistics

**YOU CAN STILL SEND US YOUR TASKS TILL MARCH 31**

- in between every video will appear a Dash flying ( added when editing).

- You have to just send us an email with 00:00 (minutes and seconds) of the first second where a flying Dash appears (it's a chroma keyed animation that stays for around 10 seconds), so just XX:XX by email

[Google Developers event platform](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-lleida/), after we announce the videos availability, see all the videos, take note of the minute and second where the dash appears, and send us email to liquidgalaxylab gmail com with the times of all the videos (or some, as you wish)

**Edited for clarity:**

Addendun: the flying Dash is the one added to the video, not the one that appears on the intro (at second 9)... thanks to @Vinayak for the finding.

- Raffle will be after Google GSoC official orgs announcement

*And remember, attending our streamings and training raises your LG Score... what's the LG Score?*Nov 18, 2025

Here are the news most of you were waiting for, the new changes in yearly community activities and

### GSoC 2026 pre-requirements

All prospective contributors will need to complete pre-requisite tasks to be considered, as we must ensure you are familiar with our tech stack and your coding capabilities, alongside your soft skills.

Please read these instructions carefully, and if you have any questions, contact us via our Gmail account. liquidgalaxylab@gmail.com

Note: You can create the tasks in the order you want, but for us to approve every task, we need them in order. **Send every task as noted, and wait for approval to send the next one.** We'll not consider contributors not follow the rules.

For every task, we need a video and the GitHub code link, if any, as proof,** so first create in your own Google Drive a folder with read permissions for everyone, with your name, surname, and GSoC 2026, and create subfolders for every task.** - ** We do not allow acceleration of the voice to keep the video on time -edited for clarity- .**We do not allow overlays from third-party screen recorders or other tools - edited for clarity-

Do not delete this till Sept 2026.

Send us your first task, sending your drive's main GSoC folder with read permissions to anyone.

**The MP4 videos -edited for clarity- **have to be 3 minutes maximum, recorded horizontally in full HD, showing your face talking and the screen recorded.


Please always name all files with the task name, your name-surname, and GSOC year (2026), like

"Yashraj-task1-gsoc2026"


### RSVP's clarification


### AI clarification

**So what's the Liquid Galaxy approach to AI use ? Simple:**

**you MUST understand h**ow the AI generated code works, and what it gives back to you. Simply a copy paste will be fast detected by our mentors, and in this case, you will be exposed to being discarded from the program at any moment.

**Also, as important as the need for something more than code, we'll never select a contributor just for sending a good proposal. We have a very tight pre-selection process, which includes the delivery of several tests and having personal meets with the mentors (**

**where they'll question you about your coding abilities, without AI help :)**

**, attending community meets, collaborating publicly in helping others at our Discord server, and more activities.**

DATELINES clarification

Contributors have to try to give us the task on time, due that we need time to evaluate your abilities, both technical and soft skills.

Contributors who arrive late to the party, nothing bad there, just simply have to hurry up.

**You can send us tasks till the very last day before Google closes its platform for proposals. -edited for clarity-**

- Task 1:

### Task 1: Install a virtual LG

*Due January 11, 2026*



**We do not support MAC OS on this,**as they have problems running the virtual machines.

[Data Spaces](https://store.liquidgalaxy.eu/app.html?name=DATA%20Spaces%20Visualization%20LG)app from contributor Marc on 2025 GSoC, which works great on a smartphone 6.x inches vertically. Please fly to the 3 kinds of data the app has to demo your rig, including all submenus on the data. - Edited for clarity--

You must use a pixel phone emulator such as 6a, 7a or any available models. Please don't resize the screen to mimic smartphones as that isn't right. Remember, the video cannot be longer than 3 minutes.

- T2:

### T2: Create a basic Flutter app

Due January 28 2026NOTE: MOST OF THIS FUNCTIONALITIES needed here, and code, ARE CLEARLY EXPLAINED IN 2025 Lucia's project.

You have to create a basic LG app, where the user can select from a simple window with a button for each action -edited for clarity-, the following activities:

[lg logo](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXmdNgBTXup6bdWew5RzgCmC9pPb7rK487CpiscWB2S8OlhwFHmeeACHIIjx4B5-Iv-t95mNUx0JhB_oATG3-Tq1gs8Uj0-Xb9Njye6rHtKKsnJQJlzZqJxMDnj_2TXX3eA5x6VSgc8aw/s320-rw/LOGO+LIQUID+GALAXY-sq1000-+OKnoline.png)to the LG (left screen of a 3 screens rig), the logo has to be visible during all the demo.

Send proof of task following rules, including a video with your face and screen to avoid cheatting, explaining your code (5 mins max) and showing too , -edited for clarity- the kml that you have created.

Send us the videos, the kml files, the released build apk, always in you GSoC drive folder, on the right subfolder, and the Github link.

### T3: Creating and delivering technical presentations

**Before recording, send an email to liquidgalaxylab@gmail.com with your 3 proposals for presentations, next with a schedule for when you plan to have those ready, as we're starting to populate the Google events platform.**

**We do not want people to do presentations about the same thing again and again, so we'll answer you on your proposed presentations.**



**before recording**, just to take a look.

**presentationtitle-t3-yourname-GSOC2026**-edited for clarity feb2-

Remember: as with all the files for GSoC, the videos have to be sent on your gsoc google drive, not Youtube on any other media. --edited for clarity

You have to overlay your face talking, and well synced, voice on the slides, as we do not want to be cheated :)

**- edited for clarity-**



**Never add music to your videos**, unless you have fully tested that has no copyright issues, as most of the videos will go to Youtube in the train the community series -edited 15.2-

As samples, and to get train you can watch the great presentations contributors did in the past, such as:

### T4: Creating at least 3 entries for our Liquid Galaxy WIKI

[Liquid Galaxy WIKI](https://www.liquidgalaxy.eu/2024/05/lg-wiki.html#content-wrapper)

*You should send us a previous email with the 3 contents you want to create for the wiki, as many other contributors may have chosen the same. And always browse our already nicely populated wiki before sending your proposals for wiki entries.*


Please write with clarity for others to understand, and quote code in the right way.

**Avoid heavy AI use; if we notice that you're simply using any LLM to create the entries, yours will not be considered, and maybe you'll be out of the GSoC race at our project.**

All the entries have to be on the same Google Doc; we’ll not accept PDFs or .docx, and please name the doc with your name and GSoC2026. And you have to send only once, with all the entries ready to review. -edited for clarity-

Each entry has to be a minimum of half a page, as you have to explain the aforementioned parts and the code or instructions involved.

You’ll be credited if the entry is published, and you can also be invited to write other ones if the ones you choose have already been written many times.

Send proof of the task following the guidelines.

### T5: Proposal Mockup creation

(This is not a must to do pre requirement! but very important for you to succeed)

This year, we want to advance the proposal creation task.

It usually happens that contributors are a bit lost and on a tight agenda when Google opens the proposal window. For this reason, we want contributors to perform a preliminary task, creating a proposal.

Our organization will provide the preliminary ideas list around mid January, and next to this, the proposal template, this year with a little bit more design thanks to Nano Banana Pro :). You'll have to select one of those ideas, or even better, think your own project idea for the Liquid Galaxy and start creating the proposal.

While this proposal can be the base for the real one, we're just making an assay, as till the end of February, usually Google will not be announcing the selected organizations for the year's GSoC.
