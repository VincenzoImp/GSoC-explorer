# 2026 Google Summer of Code - Get to Know Mifos

We're looking forward to participating in Google Summer of Code for our fourteenth year. In 2025 we worked with a total of 23 interns through Google Summer of Code, Mifos Summer of Code and our Code for GovTech across the back-end platform, our web and mobile apps, and our AI tools. We hope to continue building our next generation of contributors who are joining in our movement to fight poverty through open source software. We want you to be part of our mission of creating a world of [ 3 Billion Maries](http://www.openmf.org/impact/3-billion-maries/).

## Core DPG Technology Stack

GSOC Contributors in 2026 will have the option to work on a variety of projects related to our end to end open source stack for digital financial services including open source core banking, generative AI for financial services, real-time payment and instant payment integration, digitizing government to person (G2P) payments, mobile money and Open Banking APIs, deployment tools for the cloud, and our suite of cutting edge and web and mobile apps. Participating interns will get to work on our **Mifos X **core banking platform including the staff-facing web app built on Angular, a POC of a brand new React UI, our suite of mobile apps including field officer apps mobile banking mobile wallet apps built on Kotlin-Multiplatform, and integrations with GSMA mobile money API and Open Banking API.

We will once again have projects related to our award-winning **Payment Hub EE** which provides an orchestration engine to connect to real-time payment systems like Mojaloop, ACH, and emerging payment protocols like Interledger. Given the core stack is mature in its functionality, we continue to focus GSOC projects on maintainability and deployability, security, improving developer experience, user experience optimization in addition to bleeding edge exploratory efforts around AI and the cloud.

## Digital Public Infrastructure

With the international development’s sector deepened focused on digital public infrastructure, we are also seeking interns to contribute to our efforts with open source digital public goods for G2P payments like our Payments Building Block powered by **Payment Hub EE** and OpenG2P, the initiative we've helped to launch to digitize large scale government cash transfer programs and parallel projects for in-kind transfer and management of social registries like OpenSPP.

This year, we’ll also have a heightened focus on AI as part of AI for All and Data Science for Good initiatives. We will also have project related to our newest product,

**Mifos Gazelle**, our DaaS (DPI as a Solution) offering, providing a deployment tool to enable the rapid deployment and configuration of multiple DPGs for demonstration environments.

## AI for All

AI is a focus area for GSOC in 2026 and Mifos has long been known for its projects evaluating how AI can both enhance our products as well as assist our community. We will again be looking having a number of AI and Machine Learning projects which will have a profound impact on financial services.

Mifos has an active AI community primarily organised through its AI for All Working Group. It’s a key focus area of our community and we have a variety of projects that build upon our existing AI tools as well as exploratory ones to discover and innovate around the power Generative AI and LLMs and LAMs can have on digital financial services for the Base of the Pyramid.

We strongly encourage potential participants in AI project internships to join our working group in advance and participate, due to the fast moving field of AI this will show not only interest but also the ability to assimilate and adapt to the fast moving tech, which is often something we have to do during the project period.

## Security

Security is an imperative when working with the delivery of financial services via core banking or payments orchestration. This is a focus of GSOC in 2026.

We have worked extensively with previous interns on security-related projects to penetration test and harden our mission-critical platforms. The security and quality control experts in our community look forward to mentoring security-focused interns for all our projects as well as the emerging need for fraud detection especially as more institutions connect to real-time payments.

## Modularization on the Back and Front-End

We have some major refactoring and modularization of **Mifos X** that contributors could continue to help with. As we modularize the back-end we are also moving towards modular resuable UI components across our web and mobile apps exploring the usage of new frameworks like Compose Multi-platform and ShadCN. Through re-usable UI components, cross-platform development, frameworks, and improving our mobile SDKs, we are seeking to significantly streamline the development and design of our mobile apps.

## Integrations & POCs

Since the boundaries of fintech and financial services extend so far beyond the core we also have a number of interesting POC integration projects lined up by our mentors this year including POCs with alternative reporting engines, mobile check deposit POCs, workflow engine integration, integration with KYC automation frameworks, POCs for selfie verification, and more. We also will continue to deepen our integration with peer projects in the DPG and Financial Inclusion space such OpenSPP for Beneficiary Management, OpenFN for workflow automation, Mojaloop for Instant Inclusive Payments, MOSIP for Digital Identity and Tazama for Fraud and Risk Management.

## Payments

While both the back and front-end development of our core banking DPGs will be a major focus, we will have more projects this year on top of our **Payment Hub EE** which provides an orchestration engine to enable the ease and participation of fintechs and financial institutions into modern payment systems.

This year we will continue to improve upon the user experience of our operations app and control center, make it easier to build mobile money connectors, connect into beneficiary management systems like OpenSPP and OpenG2P for social protection, add additional connectors for messaging formats like ISO 20022, deepen our integration with instant inclusive payment systems like Mojaloop, test out integrations with new solutions like Interledger Protocol and Rafiki, and leverage open payment and banking standards.

## Small Projects

With the new category of smaller projects introduced in 2024, we do expect to have a number of projects that are more research and POC-based including:

Alignment with emerging Open Wallet Standards

Integration with Open Banking and Open Payment Standards

Design and Adoption of new frameworks like Compose Multi-platform


## Awards

Mifos X and Payment Hub EE are globally recognized digital public goods and listed as DPGs for DPI, they are also award-winning projects that sits at the cutting edge of inclusive fintech and embedded finance.

## Videos

Mifos is the leader of the open source banking movement helping to commoditize core banking infrastructure enabling financial services to be embedded anywhere and everywhere.

The best way to understand what we do is to watch a few videos.

### Voice Agent Integration to our Mobile Apps

Categories/Tags | Large, Mobile, AI, Integration, Exploratory |
|---|---|
Overview and Objectives | AI is evolving at a rapid pace, with significant progress in language models as well as in speech and speech–language models. Alongside this, language models combined with tools have increasingly taken the form of agents that can perform real-world tasks. We worked on a few projects in a similar domain last year, and this year our focus is on exploring state-of-the-art tools that can be integrated directly into our mobile applications. Our goal is to build a voice agent that can be embedded into our mobile apps to improve accessibility and inclusivity—especially for users who face barriers due to technology constraints or differences in native languages. This voice agent will allow users to interact with the app entirely through voice, perform certain actions on their behalf, and understand different features and use cases of the app without relying on traditional UI interactions. The solution is intended to use a lightweight, small-footprint model with minimal memory requirements, making it suitable for mobile environments while still delivering effective voice-based interaction. |
Description | At a high level, the core of this project will involve research and exploration into how AI-powered voice agents can be effectively integrated into mobile applications. A major focus will be identifying which features and capabilities make the most sense to expose through voice interaction, and what kinds of user operations can be reliably and safely performed using a voice-first interface. This includes understanding user experience considerations, accessibility requirements, multilingual support, and limitations specific to mobile platforms. Another key aspect of the project will be evaluating the existing ecosystem of tools, frameworks, and models that can be used to build such voice agents. This includes researching speech-to-speech systems, lightweight language or speech–language models suitable for mobile environments, and agent frameworks that support tool usage. The intern will be expected to assess trade-offs between different deployment strategies, such as using hosted/cloud-based models versus running models locally on-device, taking into account factors like latency, privacy, cost, reliability, and memory footprint. |
Skills | Kotlin / Mobile app development Python AI agents and tool-based workflows Speech-to-Text (STT) systems Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems Voice-first UX / accessibility On-device vs hosted model deployment Audio streaming and processing |
Resources | https://docs.ultravox.ai/overview |
Mifos Repositories |
|
Impact | Our mobile app is widely used in regions where English is not the primary language, and it also supports multiple Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and public infrastructure initiatives aligned with UNICEF’s goals, making inclusivity a core priority. By enabling seamless voice-based interaction, this project will allow users who may not speak English or who face technological barriers to use the app effectively through simple voice commands. In addition, the voice agent will help users better understand the app by providing guided, voice-only onboarding and explanations of its features. Overall, the project aims to significantly lower access barriers, improve user experience for diverse communities, and create meaningful social impact by making the app more accessible and inclusive. |

### Update Payment Hub EE dependencies

Categories/Tags | Large, Payment Hub EE, DPG, DPI, Integration, Mifos Gazelle, Backend, DevOps |
|---|---|
Overview and Objectives | Update Payment Hub EE Java components to most recent applicable JDK release and update corresponding dependencies such as SpringBoot, camel etc |
Description | This project will update the out of date dependencies within Payment Hub EE in particular focussed on but not limited to Java. These updates are essential to the long term sustainability of the DPG. These updates will also be used in Mifos Gazelle which incorporates Payment Hub EE for DPI demos. Whilst this project may sound simple it is not with many repos and interdependencies this project is for someone who is willing to dive deep, use investigative skills and happy that testing is a major part of upgrading of dependencies. |
Skills | Java, SpringBoot , Apache Camel, Gradle build tools |
Resources | Paymenthub repos in |
Mifos Repositories | Paymenthub repos in |
Impact | This a very important and strategic project which will enable the future development of PaymentHub EE. A longer term approach by building repeatable tests could set the scene for maintainability of PH-EE when dependancies need upgrading in the future. |

### Production-Grade E2E & Unit Testing Infrastructure for Mifos X Web App

Categories/Tags | Large (350 days), Web App, UI, Front End, Testing |
|---|---|
Overview and Objectives | The Mifos X Web App currently operates with ~1.46% test coverage, leading to fragile releases and heavy reliance on manual QA. This project aims to modernize the repository quality assurance by building a production-grade hybrid testing infrastructure using the latest industry-standard tools: Playwright 1.57+ for E2E and Jest 29+ for Unit testing, fully compatible with Angular 20. Eliminate Manual Regression Testing: Automate 40-50 critical business workflows across Client, Group, and User modules. Modernize Architecture: Implement a strict Page Object Model (POM) pattern to ensure test maintainability and reduce code duplication. Enhance Developer Experience: Create a "Testing SDK" with reusable fixtures, mock factories, and templates, enabling any contributor to write high-quality tests easily. Secure the Supply Chain: Integrate robust CI/CD quality gates in GitHub Actions to block breaking changes before merge.
|
Description | This project aims to engineer a production-grade testing ecosystem for the Mifos X Web App, shifting the repository from manual verification to a self-verifying Continuous Delivery model. By leveraging Playwright 1.57+ for End-to-End (E2E) reliability and Jest 29+ for logic isolation, the project will secure critical financial workflows currently prone to regression. Core Infrastructure & Architecture
Page Object Model (POM): Implementation of a strict POM architecture (extending the Proof-of-Concept `BasePage` ) to decouple test logic from UI selectors. This ensures that UI changes (e.g., renaming a button) only require updates in one file (`PageClassName.ts` ) rather than dozens of tests.Testing SDK: Development of reusable "Test Fixtures" and "Mock Factories" to democratise testing. This includes utilities for generating random client data, mocking API responses, and handling authentication state programmatically to bypass repetitive login screens during test runs.
Deep E2E Coverage (Client Module) The primary focus is the Client Module (171 files), which serves as the entry point for all financial operations. The project will automate the following complex business flows:
Lifecycle Management:End-to-end automation of the `Create Client` →`Approve` →`Activate` →`Close` state machine, ensuring valid transitions and error handling for invalid states (`Reject` ,`Withdraw` ).Financial Transactions: Validation of [payClientCharge], [waiveClientCharge], and [undoTransaction] logic to guarantee that account balances reflect accurately in the UI after operations. Identity & KYC: Automation of "Know Your Customer" workflows, including `Family Member` management,`Client Identifier` (document) uploads, and [Collateral] tracking to prevent compliance regressions.
Secondary Module Coverage
Groups Management: Automating group lifecycles (Creation, Meeting Notes, closure) to ensure community lending features remain stable. User Administration: Verifying the [User] module's role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized staff can approve loans or activate clients.
Unit Testing & Logic Isolation
**Component Harnessing:**Using Jest to test complex Angular 20 components (`ActivateClientComponent` ,`CreateClientComponent` ) in isolation, verifying form validators (e.g., Activation Date logic) and pipe transformations without requiring a full browser environment.Service Resilience: High-coverage unit tests for [ClientsService]) and `GroupsService` , mocking efficient`HttpClient` responses to verify error handling (e.g., 404s, Network Failures) that are difficult to reproduce in E2E.
CI/CD Pipeline Integration
Integration of a "Test Sharding" strategies in GitHub Actions to run tests in parallel, reducing pipeline duration. Configuration of **Quality Gates**that automatically block Pull Requests if they reduce overall coverage or introduce flaky tests, utilizing Playwright's "Trace Viewer" artifacts for rapid debugging of CI failures.
