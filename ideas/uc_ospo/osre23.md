Matching summer students with research mentors and sponsors.

The Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) program by the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) UC Santa Cruz provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source research efforts. The goal of the program is to seed contributor communities of open source research efforts and to help make computational research efforts reproducible. With this program the OSPO participates as mentor organization in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) and other outreach and sponsorship programs. Information from last year’s OSRE can be found [here](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/index.html) ([final reports](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/post/20220929)).

Open Source Research Experience

The 2023 Open Source Research Experience plans to apply to be a GSoC mentor organization in 2023, under the name “OSPO UC Santa Cruz” instead of “CROSS”. [CROSS](https://cross.ucsc.edu) pioneered the Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) within the UC Santa Cruz campus. In 2022, CROSS expanded OSRE to include mentors across multiple University of California campuses and has now transitioned this program to the OSPO to expand it even further. Project ideas are listed [below](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io#projects).

In addition to UC research projects, new this year is the [Summer of Reproducibility](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/sor23) with research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)). Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility.

Summer of Reproducibility projects do *not* need to have at least one UC-affliated mentor.

If you are interested, have a look at our [guidelines for students](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/forstudents) which includes timelines on when to contact mentors and proposal guidelines and expectations.

New projects for OSRE 2023 will be published by end of February. Student can begin reaching out to mentors in late February / early March. Proposals are due April 4, 2023.

Students interested in applying to any of our projects should join our Slack channel. Email [OSRE Admins](mailto:ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) to request an invitation.

You can also use our Gitter channel for general questions before reaching out to mentors. [https://gitter.im/uc_ospo-osre/community](https://gitter.im/uc_ospo-osre/community)

Due to the open source nature of all OSRE projects, contributions are welcomed from any college or university student (over the age of 18) from anywhere in the world. Please note that you must have work authorization in your country of residence to take part in this program. Please contact [ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu](mailto:ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) if you have any question on your eligibility.

We typically support the work of undergraduate students; however graduate students may also apply to work on more advanced project ideas. Please check out the project ideas page and contact the mentor if you have questions.

We are asking OSRE 2023 students and contributors to share their progress on a regular basis. We are excited to be able to highlight their work on this website and in events such as our Open Source Symposium. This [blog post](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/report/osre23/ucsc/admin/20221106-admin/) contains instructions on how to start highlighting contributor work with blog posts, also known as “student pages”. And here they are:

The UCSC OSPO is looking for mentors to be part of our 2023 Open Source Research Experience Program (OSRE), including those interested in working under the Summer of the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR). Please read the [FAQ for Mentors](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/mentorfaq) and, if interested in participating, [the instructions](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors) for posting projects.

Priority deadline for Project Ideas from Mentors is February 6, 2024.

While typical OSRE supported projects require mentors who are connected to University of California-based open source projects, thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation, the Summer of Reproducibility allows us to also support additional mentors interested in research projects related to the creation and usage of reproducibilty artifacts.

The goal of OSRE 2023 is to increase student capabilities in working in open source projects and creating reproducible artifacts, as well as add productive open source contributors and promote open source and reproducibility throughout the UC system and beyond.

The program team at UCSC OSPO values diversity and inclusion in all our projects. We invite mentors from groups traditionally excluded in computer science/open source communities to participate in this program.

If you could use undergraduate research assistance over the summer with your on-going research, this is a great opportunity to get matched to top students. Following the Google Summer of Code model, the OSRE allows the mentors to choose the students they want to work with based on an interactive and iterative proposal process. The proposal process provides mentors the opportunity to select someone they want to work with who will benefit their project and research.

Your project needs to

- EITHER have at least one mentor affiliated with one of the University of California campuses or associated DOE national labs
- OR have some connection to producing or using reproducibility artifacts.

**For University of California (UC) projects:** Any UC-affiliated faculty, researchers or graduate students working on projects that are or will ultimately be part of an open source community/ecosystem.

**For Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) projects:** Researchers and faculty from any US-based organization looking to support the open source production or use of reproducibility artifacts.

All software created as part of an OSRE project must be released as free and open source under a license that is both approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and recognized as free by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

For more details, please see the [FAQ for Mentors](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/mentorfaq) and [the instructions](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors) for posting projects.

**Is your organization looking to better utilize open source and want to support projects that directly benefit your work?**
