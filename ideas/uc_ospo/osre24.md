Matching summer students with research mentors and sponsors.

The Open Source Research Experience (OSRE) program provides support for undergraduate and graduate students contributing to open source projects and reproducible research efforts. With its dual focus on both increasing open source communities and making computational research efforts reproducible, the OSRE supports a wide variety of projects. In connection with the OSRE, the UCSC OSPO has taken part in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) as a mentor organization and managed other sponsored programs such as the NSF funded [Summer of Reproducibility](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/sor24/). Information from past OSRE years can be found here: [2023](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osre23) and [2022](https://cross.ucsc.edu/2022-osre/index.html) ([final 2022 reports](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/post/20220929)).
Mentors interested in participating in the OSRE (including for projects relevant to GSoC and the SoR) can [post their project ideas](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors/) for students to review. [Project ideas](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io#projects) are short abstracts that provide an overview of the tasks students will accomplish over the summer. See [mentor page](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io#formentors) for more details.
Interested Students or other newcomers to open source or reproducibility should review these project ideas and work with mentors to develop a full proposal. Student projects are due by April 4, 2024. See [student information page](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io#forstudents) for more details.

Open Source Research Experience

As last year OSRE 2024 will include mentors across multiple University of California campuses. Project ideas are listed [below](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io#projects).

This year will again include the [Summer of Reproducibility](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/sor24) with research projects around producing and using [reproducibility artifacts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) (see also [ctuning.org](https://ctuning.org/ae/) and [sysartifacts](https://sysartifacts.github.io)). Quite a few [conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1--Q2D0YwgNxqUfQjJohni61d554r3HpPmnjUSaKRRKQ/edit?usp=sharing) are now offering awards for reproducibility artifacts. This encourages authors to *produce* reproducibility artifacts. There is great potential for *using* these artifacts not only for validating research results but also as teaching tools in classrooms and as baselines in research labs. Making producing and using reproducibility artifacts easier can significantly accelerate the rate of insights. The Summer of Reproducibility gives summer students the opportunity to help out in this cutting-edge effort and acquire valuable skills related to reproducibility.

Summer of Reproducibility projects do *not* need to have at least one UC-affliated mentor.

If you are interested, have a look at our [guidelines for students](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/forstudents), which includes timelines on when to contact mentors and proposal guidelines and expectations.

New projects for OSRE 2024 will be published by the end of February. Students can begin reaching out to mentors after February 22, 2024. Proposals are due April 2.

Students interested in applying to any of our projects **should join our Slack channel** before March 20. Email [OSRE Admins](mailto:ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) to request an invitation.

You can also use our Gitter channel for general questions before reaching out to mentors. [https://gitter.im/uc_ospo-osre/community](https://gitter.im/uc_ospo-osre/community)
*Note that this channel is reviewed by the org admin periodically and meant for general organizational questions.*

Due to the open source nature of all OSRE projects, contributions are welcome from students or other newcomers from anywhere in the world. Please note that you must have work authorization in your country of residence to take part in this program. Please contact [ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu](mailto:ospo-info-group@ucsc.edu) if you have any questions about your eligibility.

We typically support the work of undergraduate students; however graduate students may also apply to work on more advanced project ideas. Please check out the project ideas page and contact the mentor if you have questions.

We are asking OSRE 2024 students and contributors to share their progress on a regular basis. We are excited to be able to highlight their work on this website and in events such as our Open Source Symposium. This [blog post](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/report/osre24/ucsc/admin/20231006-admin/) contains instructions on how to start highlighting contributor work with blog posts, also known as “student pages”. And here they are:

The UCSC OSPO is looking for mentors to be part of our 2024 Open Source Research Experience Program (OSRE), which this year also includes a new initiative – the Summer of Reproducibility (SoR). Please read the [FAQ for Mentors](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/mentorfaq) and, if interested in participating, [the instructions](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors) for posting projects.

While typical OSRE supported projects require mentors who are connected to University of California-based open source projects, thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation, the Summer of Reproducibility allows us to also support US-based mentors interested in research projects related to the creation and usage of reproducibilty artifacts.

The goal of OSRE 2024 is to increase student capabilities in working in open source projects and creating reproducible artifacts, as well as add productive open source contributors and promote open source and reproducibility throughout the UC system and beyond.

The program team at UCSC OSPO values diversity and inclusion in all our projects. We invite mentors from groups traditionally excluded in computer science/open source communities to participate in this program.

If you could use undergraduate research assistance over the summer with your on-going research, this is a great opportunity to get matched to top students. Like Google Summer of Code, the OSRE allows the mentors to choose the students they want to work with based on an interactive and iterative proposal process. The proposal process provides mentors the opportunity to select someone they want to work with who will benefit their project and research.

Your project needs to

- EITHER have at least one mentor affiliated with one of the University of California campuses or associated DOE national labs
- OR have some connection to producing or using reproducibility artifacts.

**For University of California (UC) projects:** Any UC-affiliated faculty, researchers or graduate students working on projects that are or will ultimately be part of an open source community/ecosystem.

**For Summer of Reproducibility (SoR) projects:** Researchers and faculty from any US-based organization looking to support the open source production or use of reproducibility artifacts.

All software created as part of an OSRE project must be released as free and open source under a license that is both approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and recognized as free by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

For more details, please see the [FAQ for Mentors](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/mentorfaq) and [the instructions](https://ucsc-ospo.github.io/osredocs/formentors) for posting projects.
