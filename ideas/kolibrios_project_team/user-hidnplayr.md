[hidnplayr@gmail.com](mailto:hidnplayr@gmail.com)[New network stack for KolibriOS](https://wiki.kolibrios.org/wiki/New_stack)I started committing code for KolibriOS around the year 2006.

Personally, I'd like to use KolibriOS at home soon, as a file server and as a media player.

In the not-so-near- future I hope to be running KolibriOS on my desktop someday.
