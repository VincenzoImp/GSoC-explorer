The KolibriOS developer team makes use of a central Git source code repository. It contains not only KolibriOS kernel and drivers, but also almost all programs and libraries that are present in this OS.

The repository is located [https://git.kolibrios.org/KolibriOS/kolibrios.git](https://git.kolibrios.org/KolibriOS/kolibrios.git)


There are also read-only repository mirrors:

Keep in mind that these repositories are for checkouts only, not commits.
