# Interested in applying for a project?

Make sure to read the [GSoC advice pages](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice/) to see how to get started, and check out the [Jitsi handbook](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/) to get yourself more familiarized with Jitsi.

Think about preparing a proposal, but *do NOT share any drafts publically to avoid being plagiarized*. We don't have the resources to review drafts anyway, so please do *NOT* include them in your introduction email.

Use of AI/LLMs for project proposals should be limited to language and grammar corrections only. Your proposal should be concise, well-organized, and demonstrate your genuine interest in the project.

# Do you have a suggestion for a new project?
