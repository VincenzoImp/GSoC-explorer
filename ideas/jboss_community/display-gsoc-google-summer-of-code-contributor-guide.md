If you are a contributor looking forward to participating in the Google Summer of Code with the JBoss community, feel free to browse the growing idea list at [GSOC - Google Summer Of Code](https://spaces.redhat.com/spaces/GSOC/pages/467057519/GSOC+-+Google+Summer+Of+Code)

### What should you do before to get accepted:

- Check out the program
[website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). - Understand how the program
[works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works). - Read the
[contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)of the program. - Make sure you are
[eligible](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor)to participate in the program. - Interact with the community using the
[communication channels](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/gsoc-2022.md#communication). - Browse the
[idea list](https://spaces.redhat.com/display/GSOC/GSOC+-+Google+Summer+Of+Code). The earlier, the better.

Points to consider while choosing any project:

1. You meet at least 50 percent of the requirements. The remaining skills can be honed on the go, so don't worry if you lack some.

2. You can relate to the project idea and you have used something related to the project as a user.

3. You are willing more toward learning the skills and less toward boasting about the skills you have already.

### Tips:

- Ask for help if you need assistance. The community will select the contributors who are not only good technically. The community expects the contributors to have interaction.
- The preferred way of asking for assistance is using the communication channels (described below). In specific cases, you can privately contact the mentor if you feel uncomfortable about the public communication.
- Start exploring early!
- Have good interaction, so that the community recognizes your name! Start by introducing yourself to the community.
- Be polite!
- Help others! Help like-minded potential contributors in the public channels.
- Check out the projects from
[previous years](https://spaces.redhat.com/display/GSOC/GSOC+-+Google+Summer+Of+Code).

If you found an idea that you think you can apply for, reach out to that project's community:

- Introduce yourself, show your GSoC intention
- Go through that project's tutorials and try on your machine
- Check out the issues that are labeled as "good-first-issue" on the project's Github repository. Try fixing them, even the simplest ones.
- Let the community know if you're stuck at any stage.

We prefer the contributors who have made more than one non trivial contributions with the corresponding project team they wish to work in GSoC tenure and specify that in the proposal.

### Communication:

[JBossOutreach #gsoc](https://gitter.im/JBossOutreach/GSoC)Gitter channel is the main GSoC-only channel for the JBoss community. People in this channel might not be familiar with any JBoss project you're interested in.- For specific JBoss project related questions, reach out to their communities. Each project idea in the idea list pages have a contact information.

### Proposal **document**

Keep in mind to keep the documentation length of around 6 pages

- Page 1 : Abstract of one page about project according to your understanding.

- Page 2-4 : Plans of 3-5 days chunk. Including buffer.

- Page 5 : Previous OpenSource pull requests within or outside of project you wish to work on.

- Page 6 : Personal details including Name, Connection details, Professional profiles, availability during GSoC period etc.

You may find a sample GSoC proposal document [here](https://spaces.redhat.com) which was for [this](https://docs.jboss.org/display/GSOC/Google+Summer+of+Code+2020+ideas#GoogleSummerofCode2020ideas-Knative-AlternativeKnativeBrokerImplementationbasedonApacheKafka) idea.
