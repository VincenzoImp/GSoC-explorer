**Project Overview**

[TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) is a powerful command-line task management tool that helps users manage their tasks efficiently through a terminal interface. It offers task synchronization, advanced filtering, and script-based integration via CLI.

## However, despite its power, **TaskWarrior lacks a modern cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI)** that can match its CLI capabilities. To bridge this gap, we built a **Flutter-based mobile app** for TaskWarrior that allows users to:

## ✅ **What We Achieved Last Year (2025)**

Last year, we made significant progress by:

- 🚀
**Migrating most of the codebase to GetX**for better state management. - 💾 Enabling sync with
**TaskServer 2.0 (TS 2.0)**. - 📱 Improving the mobile app's usability and performance.
- Unit tests

However, a few key challenges still remain:

- Some parts of the app
**still use the old provider-based state management**, so we want to complete the migration to**GetX**. - We
**haven't fully integrated CCSync/TaskServer 3.0**(which we built separately), and our app only supports TaskServer 2.0. - We lack automated build releases (to
**F-Droid**) and automated testing workflows. - There's
**no iOS home widget**for quick task access. - Desktop optimization is still missing despite Flutter's growing desktop support.

## ✅ **Your Task for This Year (2026)**

This year, we aim to **finalize the TaskWarrior app** by:

**Completing the migration to GetX**.**Extending sync support for CCSync (TaskServer 3.0)**without breaking existing TaskServer 2.0 support.**Automating nightly builds via F-Droid and GitHub Actions**.**Building an iOS home screen widget**for quick task access.**Optimizing the app for desktop usage (macOS)**.**Ensuring complete test coverage**(unit, integration, end-to-end).**Simplifying codebase architecture**and reducing unnecessary bloat.**Maintaining the core TaskWarrior philosophy**— minimal, fast, and powerful.

**Key Deliverables**

### ✅ **1. Complete Migration to GetX (High Priority)**

- A large portion of the app has already been migrated to
**GetX**, but some modules still use**heavy setState**for state management. - Your task will be to:
- 🚀 Move the remaining sections to
**GetX**. - 💡 Ensure state management is clean, reusable, and optimized.
- ✅ Remove redundant code and reduce app bloat.

- 🚀 Move the remaining sections to
- This will future-proof the app and improve scalability.

### ✅ **2. Integrate CCSync (TaskServer 3.0) Without Breaking TaskServer 2.0**

**Current State:**The app supports sync only with**TaskServer 2.0**.**Goal:**Extend support for**CCSync/TaskServer 3.0**without breaking existing TaskWarrior 2.0 functionality.**Tasks:**- 🔄
**Create separate data models**for TaskServer 2.0 and TaskServer 3.0. - 💡 Implement an UI to allow user which taskserver they want to use for different profiles.
- 📡 Provide seamless sync functionality for both versions.
- 💬
**Collaborate with CCSync developers**to ensure full compatibility.

- 🔄

💡 **Note:** Some groundwork has already been done to integrate CCSync, so your job will be to **improve, optimize, and finalize** the integration.

### ✅ **3. Build Full Test Coverage (Must-Have)**

- The app currently lacks complete test coverage. Your task will be to:
- 🚀 Write
**unit tests**for all major functionalities. - 🧪 Implement
**integration tests**to ensure seamless task sync. - ✅ Enable
**end-to-end testing**using Flutter integration tests. - 📊 Achieve
**at least 90% test coverage**across the codebase.

- 🚀 Write

This will ensure production-level stability and prevent future bugs.

### ✅ **4. Automate Nightly Builds (to F-Droid + GitHub Actions)**

- One major issue is that our app doesn't have automated builds.
- Your task will be to:
- 🤖 Setup
**F-Droid**for nightly builds. - 🔄 Create
**GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows**that automatically:- Build APK and AAB packages.
- Push releases to
**F-Droid**. - Notify on failures via GitHub Actions.


- 🤖 Setup
- This will drastically simplify app distribution for users.

### ✅ **5. Develop an iOS Home Widget for Quick Task Access**

- Create an iOS home screen widget that allows users to:
- ✅ View pending tasks.
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed.
- ✅ Add new tasks quickly.

- This will significantly improve user retention for iOS users.
- Android widget is already done :

### ✅ **6. Optimize Desktop Support (macOS/Linux)**

- Since
**Flutter now supports desktop**, we want to optimize TaskWarrior to:- ✅ Run smoothly on
**macOS/Linux/Windows desktops**. - ✅ Provide a desktop-friendly UI/UX.
- ✅ Sync tasks seamlessly across desktop and mobile.

- ✅ Run smoothly on
- This will position
**TaskWarrior**as a powerful multi-platform task manager.

### ✅ **7. Ensure No Feature Regression**

- One of our biggest concerns is
**breaking existing functionality**. - Your task is to ensure that:
- ✅ TaskServer 2.0 sync continues to work as-is.
- ✅ TaskServer 3.0 integration works without conflict.
- ✅ The app does not introduce unnecessary bloat or complexity.


### ✅ **8. iOS App**

- Release the first version of the Flutter app in AppStore
- Test all the features and make sure all works.

### ✅ **9. Propose Minimalist Improvements (Optional but Appreciated)**

- We
**don't want to make TaskWarrior bloated**like other task managers. - However, we encourage you to propose:
- Minimalist UI improvements.
- Feature enhancements that
**align with TaskWarrior's philosophy**. - Improvements that boost productivity without adding complexity.


## ✅ **Why Is This Project Important?**

By completing this project, you'll help:

- 🚀 Make
**TaskWarrior a powerful cross-platform task manager**. - 🔄 Provide seamless sync between mobile, desktop, and CLI.
- 📲 Improve the overall user experience for TaskWarrior users.
- 💾 Ensure TaskWarrior remains fast, minimal, and focused.

We don't want bloat — we want **efficiency, speed, and simplicity**.

## ✅ **Tech Stack**

Here's the preferred tech stack:

**Frontend:**

- ✅
**Flutter + Dart**(mandatory). - ✅
**GetX**for state management.

**CI/CD:**

- ✅
**GitHub Actions**. - ✅
**F-Droid**for nightly releases.

**Testing:**

- ✅ Flutter Test / Integration Test.
