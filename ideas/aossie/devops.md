# DevOps and Repo Quality

## Background and Motivation

Many of our repos were created with limited resources and thus tasks related to DevOps (e.g. setting up CI/CD workflows and github actions, releases, changelogs, licenses, readmes, tests, badges, templates) have often been neglected. Furthermore, even when we did some of these tasks in some of our repos, they were done by different people, without following common standards and possibly without following the state-of-the art.

We need a common standard for our entire orgs in github, and we must ensure that all our repos are following these standards.

## Overview of Tasks

* Create templates, standards and default workflows/actions, according to the latest state-of-the-art and to the needs of our orgs
* Update all our repos to conform to the created templates and standards and to utilize the created default workflows/actions

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals. Please detail which workflows, templates and standards you will create.


## Mentors

* Since this idea involves contributing to multiple projects, you will interact with multiple mentors and the exact mentors will depend on the projects for which you will contribute. Look for mentors with @Mentor and @Contributor-X role in our discord, where X is the name of the project.
* GitHub: @M4dhav; Discord: @m4dhav
* GitHub: @Zahnentferner ; Discord: @b.wp
