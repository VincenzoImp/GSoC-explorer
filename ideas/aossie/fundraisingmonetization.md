# Fundraising and Monetization

## Background and Motivation

AOSSIE is a not-for-profit charity in Australia, capable of receiving tax-deductible donations. Yet, we have never tried to raise funding besides the funds provided by Google Summer of Code. Furthermore, our projects are all free, ad-free and have no revenue stream.

If AOSSIE could have additional revenue streams or additional sources of funding, we could do more of the great things we have been doing.

This idea is to brainstorm and execute ways of increasing AOSSIE's capacity to raise funds, diversify its revenues and make its projects financially self-sustainable.


## Overview of Tasks

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that could be done:

* Set up all our repos to receive donations/support.
* Create a sponsorship program and implement it in AOSSIE's website.
* For each of our projects, find a way of monetizing it without degrading the user experience, and implement it.
* For each of our projects, implement a way to allow users to donate to AOSSIE.


Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Resources

* Here is Python Software Foundation's sponsorship approach: https://pypi.org/sponsors/
* Look for inspiration in what other umbrella organizations and open-source projects do to raise funds and sustain themselves.
  

## Mentors

* Since this idea involves contributing to multiple projects, you will interact with multiple mentors and the exact mentors will depend on the projects for which you decide to contribute. Look for Mentors with @Mentor and @Contributor-X role in AOSSIE's discord and @Knight and @X in the Discord of the Stability Nexus, where X is the name of the project.
