# Discord/Github Bot

## Background and Motivation

As our organizations are becoming larger, it is becoming increasingly more time-consuming and harder to manually manage our Discords and our Github orgs.

We need a bot capable of automating what we do in both Discord and GitHub and, especialy, in the interaction between the two.

Although there are many discord bots and many github apps, we are not aware of any bot/app that integrates the two in a way that satisfies our needs.

We believe this bot would be useful for other large organizations as well.

## Overview of Tasks

* Implement a Discord/Github bot that is simple to use and that automates synchronization between the two.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Requirements

* The bot should be executable on any computer. It should not be necessary to host the bot on some cloud server.
* The bot should not be required to be online all the time.
* The bot should be capable of assigning roles in Discord based on activity observed in GitHub.
* The bot should be capable of assigning issues and PR reviews to users that have specific roles in Discord.
* The bot should be capable of keeping track of contributions of users and assign scores/tokens to users based on these contributions.
* The bot should be configurable and generable enough so that it is useful not only to our own orgs, but to other open-source orgs.


## Mentors

* People with the @Admin role in our Discord.
