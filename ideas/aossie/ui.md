# Improve and Modernize UI/UX of Our Projects

## Background and Motivation

UI/UX is a rapidly evolving field. From time to time, we need to update the UI/UX pf some of our projects to align them with the latest trends and expectations.

AOSSIE is 10 years old and some of its projects are 15 years old. Some of our interfaces are a bit outdated from a UI/UX point of view.

We are looking for contributors with good design and frontend skills and good artistic and usability sensibility to improve our user interfaces.


## Overview of Tasks

* For each of our projects, analyze the current UI/UX and propose improvements. After the proposed improvements are accepted, execute them.

* Make our interfaces display well independently of screen size, device type and browser.

Do this for as many of our projects as possible.

## Requirements

* UIs should be clean and minimalistic.
* UIs/UXs should be easy to maintain and update. We don't want to have to throw away and redo interfaces every year.




## Mentors

* Since this idea involves contributing to multiple projects, you will interact with multiple mentors and the exact mentors will depend on the projects for which you decide to contribute. Look for mentors with @Mentor and @Contributor-X role in AOSSIE's discord and X role in the discord of the Stability Nexus, where X is the name of the project.
