# Agora Blockchain: Decentralized Cross-Chain Voting & Governance Platform

## Background and Motivation

Agora Blockchain is a decentralized voting platform built to improve electoral integrity, transparency, and accessibility. Traditional voting systems, both online and offline, suffer from centralization, limited auditability, and trust issues. Even existing blockchain-based voting solutions often lack flexibility in voting mechanisms, cross-chain participation, and user-friendly onboarding.

Agora addresses these gaps by leveraging smart contracts and Chainlink CCIP to enable tamper-proof, verifiable, and cross-chain elections. While the core system is functional, there is significant scope to enhance privacy, scalability, analytics, and user experience to make Agora suitable for real-world governance, DAOs, and institutional elections.

This project focuses on strengthening Agora’s smart contracts, expanding cross-chain capabilities, improving the frontend experience, and adding meaningful analytics—while preserving decentralization and trust guarantees.

## Overview of Tasks

* **Smart contract improvements**

  * Improve private/confidential elections using cryptographic techniques
  * Optimize election factory and voting contracts for lower gas consumption

* **Cross-chain voting expansion**

  * Extend Chainlink CCIP integration to enable voting across multiple blockchains
  * Design secure message passing and result aggregation across chains

* **Analytics and insights**

  * Develop a real-time dashboard for election statistics
  * Track voter participation, turnout, and engagement metrics

* **Feedback and iteration**

  * Gather community feedback
  * Refine usability, performance, and security based on real-world usage

Candidates are expected to refine and prioritize these tasks in their GSoC proposals.


## Requirements

* Strong understanding of **Solidity** and smart contract development
* Experience with **Hardhat** for testing and deployment
* Familiarity with **Chainlink CCIP** or cross-chain communication concepts
* Frontend experience using **Next.js**, **Wagmi**, and wallet integrations (MetaMask)
* Knowledge of modern frontend tooling (**TailwindCSS**, **Zustand**)
* Ability to work with existing decentralized systems and extend them incrementally
* Interest in governance, DAOs, and blockchain-based voting systems
