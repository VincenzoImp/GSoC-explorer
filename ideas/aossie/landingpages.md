# Design and Implement Great-Looking Landing Pages for our Projects

## Background and Motivation

Many of our projects exist merely as a github repo. This is adequate for projects whose target audience are developers, but not for projects intended for end-users.

For projects intended for end-users, we need nice-looking landing pages. So, for this idea, we are looking for a contributor with good design and front-end development skills willing to work together with the maintainers of our end-user facing projects to create great landing pages for as many of our projects as possible.

AI generation means that it is now easy to quickly generate landing pages. And AI generation should be used to speed up the implementation of this idea. But, of course, we would like our landing pages to be better than just generic AI-generated pages.

We want our landing pages to elegantly express AOSSIE's brand and each project's individual brand as well.


## Overview of Tasks

* For each of our user-facing projects, create a landing page that is purely static.
* Deploy each landing page in github pages with custom domain at https://<project-name>.aossie.org .



## Requirements

* The pages need to be purely static
* The pages need to have excellent search engine optimization.


## Ideators

* GitHub: @Zahnentferner ; Discord: @b.wp


## Mentors

* GitHub: @M4dhav; Discord: @m4dhav
* GitHub: @Zahnentferner ; Discord: @b.wp
* Since this idea involves contributing to multiple projects, you will interact with multiple mentors and the exact mentors will depend on the projects for which you decide to contribute. Look for Mentors with `@Mentor` and `@Contributor-X` role in our discord, where `X` is the name of the project.
