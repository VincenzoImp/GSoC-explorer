# Djed Stablecoin Protocol on EVM

Our Djed stablecoin initiative spans multiple Solidity implementations and supporting services. Two protocol variants exist today:

* **Djed Osiris** – implemented with ETH backing and ERC-20 backing. The ETH-backed deployment is live on Ethereum Classic at https://etc.djed.one, with its frontend in the main branch of [Djed-Solidity-WebDashboard](https://github.com/DjedAlliance/Djed-Solidity-WebDashboard). The ERC-20 backed Solidity contracts also exist and are paired with a deployment/frontend tool (not ready for production) at [Djed-Solidity-ERC20BaseCoin-WebUI](https://github.com/DjedAlliance/Djed-Solidity-ERC20BaseCoin-WebUI).
* **Djed Shu** – implemented with ETH backing (contracts are ready, frontend lives in the `feat/shu-frontend` branch of the WebDashboard repo) but never launched.

To support these deployments, we run several auxiliary projects:

* **OrbOracle** (contracts + EVM frontend) to provision price oracles for ERC-20 collateral tokens.
* **StablePay** (widget + merchant demos + dashboard + landing page) to enable payments with Djed; currently only works with Djed Osiris.

The roadmap introduces two streamlined protocol versions:

* **Djed Tefnut** – simplifies Djed Shu by removing min/max reserve ratios, removing `sellBothCoins`, and removing the linear decay of the treasury fee.
* **Djed Isis** – simplifies Djed Osiris using the same changes as Tefnut.

## Proposed GSoC Tasks

1. Implement Djed Tefnut Solidity contracts backed by ETH, starting from the existing Djed Shu codebase.
2. Update the Djed Shu frontend to support the new Tefnut contracts, exposing all required flows.
3. Deploy Tefnut to a public testnet and validate end-to-end functionality with the updated frontend.
4. Extend StablePay so it can interact with Tefnut-based stablecoins.
5. Implement Djed Isis contracts with ERC-20 collateral, reusing the Djed Osiris ERC-20 backed implementation as a baseline.
6. Adapt the ERC-20 frontend (https://github.com/DjedAlliance/Djed-Solidity-ERC20BaseCoin-WebUI) so that users can deploy and manage Djed Isis stablecoins.
