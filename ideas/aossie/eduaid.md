# Interactive Quiz Experience for EduAid

## Background and Motivation

EduAid is highly effective at generating high-quality quizzes from educational content. Currently, these quizzes are primarily consumed as static artifacts, which works well for individual and asynchronous learning.

This idea explores the possibility of introducing an **optional interactive quiz experience** within EduAid to improve engagement and support collaborative learning scenarios, while preserving the value of existing static quizzes.

## Overview of Tasks

* Explore designs for an interactive quiz mode that can coexist with static quizzes
* Define a minimal and accessible initial scope for interaction
* Prototype a basic real-time quiz flow with immediate feedback
* Ensure the interactive experience integrates cleanly with existing quiz generation
* Gather feedback and iterate on usability and engagement

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Requirements

* Familiarity with web development (frontend and backend)
* Understanding of real-time or event-driven user interactions
* Ability to design user-friendly interfaces with minimal complexity
* Experience working with existing codebases and extending features incrementally

## Mentors

* GitHub: @yatikakain; Discord: @yatikakain
* GitHub: @Aditya062003; Discord: @duney06
* Look for mentors with the role `@Contributor-EduAid` in our discord servers
