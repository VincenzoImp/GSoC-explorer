# Org Explorer

## Background and Motivation

As an organization gets larger, in number of repos and number of contributors, 
it becomes increasingly harder to keep track of all activities within the organization
relying only on GitHub's UI. The information shown in a organization's github profile 
is insufficient and it is impractical to manually inspect every repo to obtain more information
about the organization's overall activity.

In the past 10 years, AOSSIE has grown significantly and 
is now experiencing these challenges first-hand.

It would be highly beneficial, for the management and governance of AOSSIE and
other masively distributed decentralized open organizations
to have an _Organization Explorer_ web app that would take data from github's API
and display this data in summarized, condensed, statistical forms.


## Overview of Tasks

* Create an _Organization Explorer_ web app with good-looking UI and intuitive UX, 
to fetch and display information about organizations in GitHub.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals. 
Please detail which information you are going to fetch and how you are going to display it.
Please include figma designs of the proposed UI/UX.

## Requirements

* The web-app should be a lean "sunny" cloud-less application that does not rely 
on any backend and can be easily run on any browser.
* Data should be stored locally using local storage and indexedDB.
* Fetched data should be cached locally, to avoid exceeding GitHub's API limits.


## Mentors

* Look for mentors with the `@Admin` role in AOSSIE's discord
* GitHub: @Zahnentferner ; Discord: @b.wp
