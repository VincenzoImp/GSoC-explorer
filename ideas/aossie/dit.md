# Decentralized Identity Tokens

## Background and Motivation

In GSoC 2025 we created two project that aim to increase trust among people in a decentralized way: 
TNT (Trust Network Tokens) and VouchMe (OnChain Testimonials). 

In 2026, we would like to give continuation to this direction by creating a new project that allows 
people to issue their own identity tokens and endorse the identity tokens of others.

In the legacy world, identity documents are issued and endorsed by governments. 
For example, when you get a passport, the government is endrosing the fact that you, 
the passport holder, has the characteristics described in the passport that identify you 
(your photo, your date of birth, your nationality, ...).

With identity tokens, anyone can self-issue a token with any characteristics and anybody 
can endorse that the holder of the token is indeed the entity that has those charcteristics.


## Overview of Tasks

* Implement token smart contract.
* Implement frontend to interact with the token smart contract to create identity tokens and endorse identity tokens.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Requirements

* The identity tokens should be ERC-721 NFTs.
* There should be an on-chain mapping of each token to its metadata.
* The metadata should contain fields such as: name, links to profiles in various social media websites (e.g. twitter, linkedin, ...), age, age group, nationality, residence, ...
* All fields should be optional.
* A user may have more than one token.
* There should be information about which identity tokens have endorsed which other identity tokens.
* The data structures should be efficient to retrieve which identities have endorsed a given identity and which identities have been endorsed by a given identity.


## Resources

* [VouchMe](https://github.com/StabilityNexus/VouchMe)
* [TNT](https://github.com/StabilityNexus/TNT)
* Also, read articles about decentralized digital identities (a.k.a. DIDs) and self-sovereign identities.

## Mentors

* Look for mentors with the roles @Contributor-StabilityNexus in AOSSIE's Discord and the @TNT and @VouchMe roles in the Discord of teh Stability Nexus.
