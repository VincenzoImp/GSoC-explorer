# Neurotrack

## Background and Motivation

**Project Size: Large**

[Neurotrack](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/NeuroTrack) is an innovative platform that leverages artificial intelligence to support the detection, assessment, and management of neurodevelopmental conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and various learning difficulties. The platform connects patients/clients with qualified therapists through two dedicated applications, streamlining the assessment, consultation, and therapy management process.
