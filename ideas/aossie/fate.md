# Fate Protocol: Bull/Bear Coins as Native Oracles

Fate Protocol is a decentralized, perpetual prediction market that operates continuously without expiration. It replaces traditional order books with a dual-vault system—where users buy and sell **bullCoins** and **bearCoins**—enabling hedging against market trends in a fluid, always-on ecosystem.

## Current State

Fate Protocol currently enables users to:

* Trade bullCoins (betting on price increases) and bearCoins (betting on price decreases)
* Create perpetual prediction pools for any asset pair
* Use external oracles (Chainlink, Hebeswap) for price feeds
* Participate in decentralized price prediction markets across multiple chains

Fate Protocol is deployed across multiple EVM-compatible networks: Ethereum, Base, BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum Classic, and Polygon. The protocol uses a dual-vault system with separate vaults for bullCoins and bearCoins, featuring dynamic fee structures and automated reserve balancing.


## Proposed GSoC Tasks

1. **Oracle Interface Implementation** – Design and implement `IFateOracle` interface compatible with Chainlink's `AggregatorV3Interface`. Extend bull/bear coin contracts to expose price data in standardized format. Add price history tracking with round-based system. Implement `getLatestPrice()` and `getLatestRoundData()` functions.

2. **Price Derivation Mechanism** – Develop price calculation formulas using bull/bear coin reserves and supply. Implement sentiment-based price adjustment: `oraclePrice = f(bullPrice, bearPrice, basePrice)`. Add volume-weighted price aggregation for accuracy. Create time-decay mechanisms for historical price relevance.

3. **Oracle Adapter Contract** – Build `FateOracleAdapter` contract wrapping bull/bear coins. Provide Chainlink-compatible interface for easy DeFi integration. Handle price normalization and formatting. Support multiple price derivation strategies (direct, implied, weighted).

4. **Testing** – Write unit/integration/fuzz tests to prove numerical correctness, to guard against overflow/precision loss, and to ensure Fate oracles gracefully handle low liquidity, stale data, and paused pools.

5. **Documentation** – Document the oracle interface and integration guide with clear explanations of the implementation so that new users can understand how Fate oracles work and integrate them correctly.
