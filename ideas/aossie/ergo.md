# Porting our EVM Projects to Ergo

## Background and Motivation

In GSoC 2025, many contributors created new crypto projects 
for EVM-compatible blockchains.

We have a long and fruitful relationship with the Ergo blockchain, 
which is not EVM-compatible, and we would like to port all our projects to Ergo, 
with higher priority for DeFi-related projects.


## Overview of Tasks

* For any of our EVM projects, redo the smart contracts in Ergo script and adapt the frontends.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals. 
Depending on the complexity of the project, it may be possible to port more than
1 project in a single GSoC project.
