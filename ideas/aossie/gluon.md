# Gluon Reactors: Multi-Oracle Price Feed Selection

The Create Reactor flow currently locks users into Pyth as the sole oracle provider. While Pyth delivers reliable data, limiting Gluon to a single source restricts resilience and the ability to leverage in-house infrastructure such as OrbOracle or widely used alternatives like Chainlink. This project unlocks configurability so that each Reactor (and the `StableCoin.sol` backing it) can choose whichever oracle best suits its market.

## Motivation and Background

* In Orb, all price feeds are registered via the Factory contract, and an Explorer already surfaces contract addresses and metadata.
* Inside `StableCoin.sol` we currently store `pythOracleParam` (contract address) and `priceIdParam` (feed identifier). These must evolve into a generalized structure that can route reads to Pyth, Chainlink, or OrbOracle.
* Yogesh’s adapters for Djed demonstrated how a unified interface can proxy multiple providers (Milkomeda, Chainlink, HebeSwap). Their approach is a useful reference, although it incurs additional internal calls, so gas/complexity trade-offs must be evaluated.

Because Gluon spans Solidity contracts plus the Reactor creation web UI, the selected design must consider both on-chain and front-end ergonomics. Before coding, contributors should sync in the Stability Nexus dev channel to align on the architecture.

## Proposed GSoC Tasks

1. **Contract abstraction** – Define an oracle interface/struct that can encapsulate provider type, feed identifiers, and scaling. Refactor `StableCoin.sol` (and other Reactor contracts) to depend on that abstraction rather than Pyth-only storage.
2. **Provider adapters** – Implement adapters for Pyth, Chainlink, and OrbOracle. Reuse ideas from the Djed adapter work where possible while minimizing redundant calls and ensuring consistent validation (staleness, confidence intervals, heartbeats).
3. **Factory + configuration flow** – Update the Reactor Factory so deployments accept the new oracle configuration, enforce whitelists, and store metadata needed by downstream governance or monitoring.
4. **Frontend enhancements** – Extend the Reactor Creation Page to let creators search/select feeds from Orb Explorer, paste Chainlink addresses, or pick Pyth IDs. The UI should surface provider-specific warnings (e.g., confidence bounds) and highlight gas trade-offs.
5. **Testing + documentation** – Deliver simulations/tests that cover provider switching, fallback scenarios, and misconfiguration. Document the oracle-selection UX, contract interfaces, and recommended practices for integrating future providers.
