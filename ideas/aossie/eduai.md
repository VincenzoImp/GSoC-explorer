# Novel AI-Powered Education-Focused Apps

## Background and Motivation

AOSSIE has a long tradition of creating apps that use AI to enable education that predates the current AI hype.

For example, Mind The Word was developed in 2011 and uses AI-based translation to help users learn new languages.
More recently, we have developed: EduAid, which helps teachers and students to automatically generate quizzes; 
BabyNest, which helps parents to learn how to care for babies; 
DebateAI, for people wanting to improve their debate skills; 
NeuroTrack, for people to learn about ASD, ADHD and other neurological learning conditions; ...

We would like to continue innovating and creating new apps that use AI in novel ways to support learning.


## Overview of Tasks

* Create a mobile app or a web app that uses AI in a novel way to support learning.

Candidates are expected to refine these tasks in their GSoC proposals.

## Requirements

* The AI model should be local and/or the user should be allowed to input his/her own subscription key to a SaaS AI model.
* We are looking for more than just AI wrappers.
* There should be no backened or SaaS/Cloud dependencies.


## Mentors

* Look for mentors with the roles
  `@Contributor-EduAid`, `@Contributor-DebateAI`, `@Contributor-MindTheWord`,
  `@Contributor-BabyNest`, `@Contributor-NeuroTrack` in our discord servers.
