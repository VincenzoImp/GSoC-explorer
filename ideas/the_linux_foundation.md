# Google Summer of Code 2026

This is our list of project ideas for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program in [2026](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/12/shape-future-with-google-summer-of-code.html).

**Dear contributors**, if you want to apply for doing a Google Summer of Code project with us you can choose a project from our workgroup's lists but you can also present your own idea fitting to any of the workgroups below. Please note that you have to choose "The Linux Foundation" as your mentoring organization, independent of the workgroup where you want to do your project.

The organizers of the GSoC are especially welcoming projects about **security** and about **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)**. They will give special support to these. We will also mark appropriate project ideas in the project idea lists. Also consider this if you come up with your own idea or if you are a mentor adding project ideas to our lists.

## Dates

  * *February 19, 2026* - The accepted mentoring organizations will get announced
  * *March 16, 2026* - Applications open for contributors
  * *March 31, 2026* - Deadline for contributors to apply

## Notes to take for contributors

**Note:** Many of the links come from Google Summer of Code programs of the past. Therefore if you read the word "student", consider this as "contributor". No proof of enrollment at college or university is required (at least for those who enter as free-software newcomer).

  * Read the [GSoC Manual](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline), and [GSoC FAQs](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq)
  * On your application be sure to mention which of the listed Linux Foundation workgroups and, if applicable which of their listed project ideas you are applying for. If you are suggesting your own idea be sure to clarify that.
  * Follow the scheme of our [[contributor application template|contributor-application-template]].
  * Follow the [DOs and DON'Ts](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleOpenSourceBlog+%28Google+Open+Source+Blog%29) for contributors.
  * On the front page click the field to apply as a contributor and then choose "The Linux Foundation" as your mentoring organization from the long list. To find it, use the filter field under "Name" or use the drop-down menu at the bottom to display the full list (there are more than 150 organizations).

## Contact us!

Before applying, please have a look at the page(s) of the desired workgroup(s) linked below and do not hesitate to ask questions using the contact info (e-mail, IRC) of the workgroup in which you want to do your project. Often they want to get involved with you before you apply, starting to integrate you into their community, so introduce yourself to them as soon as possible. For general questions about participating as GSoC contributor in projects of the Linux Foundation, please contact the organization administrotors (see below).

## Our source code repositories

Our projects are free software and therefore open-source. So all the source code is publicly available. Usually it is managed by version control systems, in most cases GIT. Each workgroup manages the code by itself, most of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/), but also at other hosting services or the workgroup's own servers, for example https://github.com/linuxfoundation, https://github.com/OpenPrinting, https://git.kernel.org/, http://git.automotivelinux.org/, ...

See the workgroup's pages linked above for their web presence and code locations.

## Organization Administrators

The participation of the Linux Foundation in the Google Summer of Code is organized by Till Kamppeter (till at linux dot com) and Aveek Basu (basu dot aveek at gmail dot com).
