# Open Food Facts Explorer - a new generation frontend

## Description

The Open Food Facts Explorer is a modern frontend for Open Food Facts, developed using SvelteKit. It offers functionalities such as basic editing, product page displays with Knowledge Panels support, search capabilities, and user authentication. Additionally, it incorporates the new Folksonomy Engine and a taxonomy explorer, enhancing data organization and accessibility.

## Expected outcomes

The main objective of the project is to refine and expand its features to align with the standard Open Food Facts website.

- Decoupling the backend from the frontend will improve the long-term maintainability of the codebase, while leveraging a modern JavaScript framework will facilitate the development of new features.
- It also has the potential to make the website far more easy to use on a mobile, which constitute more than 70% of visits
- SvelteKit's support for server-side rendering (SSR) and emphasis on accessibility enhance the responsiveness of the web application, broadening its potential reach.

The development roadmap remains flexible, allowing adjustments during iterations to improve usability and ensure feature completeness.

We strive to reuse our JS SDK (openfoodfacts-nodejs) and to put some features into reusable webcomponents.
