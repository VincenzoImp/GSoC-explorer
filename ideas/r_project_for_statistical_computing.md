# table of proposed coding projects

[9 revisions](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2026/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects/_history)

Mentors, please edit this wiki page, and add your ideas to the table below.

Contributors, please look for a project that interests you in the table below. Before emailing project mentors, please do at least one project Test and post a link to your solution on the proposal’s wiki page.

| Proposal | Hours | Status/Results | Mentors | Non-R languages? |

Project ideas where no contributor has yet contacted mentors should be listed as ‘need contributor’. Project ideas where one or more potential contributors are communicating with mentors should have a status of ‘potential contributors’. You can still communicate your interest to mentors to apply to projects with status “potential contributor” – that implies that there is another contributor who has already shown some capability for that project (see below for more details on how we evaluate applications). Projects that need to identify another mentor (e.g. to find a mentor with a specific skill, or from a different institution) should be marked with a status of ‘need mentor’ and the idea page should provide details in the ‘Mentors’ section.

All contributor applications will be discussed by the R mentor community, and proposals will be ranked considering factors such as quality, difficulty, and impact for the R community. Slots are a finite resource granted to R by Google, and only the best proposals will get chosen. In prior years, R has received 4-5 times more applications than slots, so application quality is key.

Contributors, if you have an idea for an R package coding project that is
not listed above, please
[try to find mentors
by posting a description of your project idea on the r-gsoc google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gsoc-r). If you find mentors, feel free to add your project idea to
this wiki. You should NOT submit any project applications to Google
without finding TWO mentors for your project proposal.
