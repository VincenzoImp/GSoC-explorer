# TARDIS Core Package Documentation[¶](https://tardis-sn.github.io#tardis-core-package-documentation)

TARDIS is an open-source [Monte Carlo](https://tardis-sn.github.io/resources/zreferences.html#term-Monte-Carlo) radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code
for 1D models of supernova ejecta. It is designed for rapid spectral modelling
of supernovae. It is developed and maintained by a
[multi-disciplinary team](https://tardis-sn.github.io/people/collaboration/)
including software engineers, computer scientists, statisticians,
and astrophysicists.

The tardis package is the core package provided by the TARDIS Project. To learn
more about the complete project, other packages it provides, and the community
behind it, please check the [project website](https://tardis-sn.github.io).

If you use this code for any publications or presentations please follow our
citation guidelines in [Credits & Publication Policies](https://tardis-sn.github.io/resources/credits.html#tardiscredits).

User modifications and additions that lead to publications **need to be handed
back to the community** by incorporating them into TARDIS.
Please contact the TARDIS team via the [GitHub page](https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis) if you have questions or need
assistance.

## Mission Statement[¶](https://tardis-sn.github.io#mission-statement)


The mission of the TARDIS community is to develop open-source software instruments to analyze and simulate astronomical transients (supernovae, kilonovae, etc.) for research and education purposes. We aim to build up a diverse group of researchers and developers using an open-community model that emphasizes interdisciplinary research and science reproducibility.
