---

In 2026 ML4SCI plans to participate in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization.
The ML4SCI organization plans to partner with the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) in 2026 to broaden student participation in machine learning projects over a wide variety of scientific fields.
ML4SCI participants will be mentored by scientists at top research universities and laboratories on research projects at the cutting edge of science.
Projects span a wide range of scientific domains, including physics, astronomy, planetary science, quantum information science and others.

In 2026 GSoC students work with their mentors for 175 hrs to produce open-source codes that apply machine learning solutions to solve science problems. Projects span three evaluation periods that allow for students and mentors to collaborate on their project and evaluate student progress. Detailed rules for the GSOC program can be found on Google’s [rules page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/).
Interested students should look at the ideas page and contact the mentors. Candidates will be asked to complete an evaluation test for each project they apply to demonstrate the skills needed for the respective projects.
In the next step, students will produce a proposal which will be evaluated for final student selection.

[DeepLense](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07346) is a deep learning pipeline for particle dark matter searches with strong gravitational lensing.

The [End-to-End Deep Learning (E2E)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11916) project focuses on the development of particle and event reconstruction and identification tasks with end-to-end deep learning approaches.

The purpose of EXXA is to use simulations and publicly available data from observations intended to identify exoplanets and physical processes in planet-forming environments.

DeepFalcon is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments.

FASEROH is an open source project researching seq2seq model that maps histograms to empirical symbolic representations.

The GENIE project focuses on the application of novel machine learning techniques to anomaly detection and event generation in particle physics

High-Energy Physics Simulation (HEPSIM) applies modern machine learning and agentic AI methods to Monte Carlo event generation and simulation in high-energy physics. Projects range from developing symbolic regression techniques for event reweighting and curating jet observable libraries, to deploying ML algorithms that quantify simulation biases between generators such as Pythia and Herwig. More advanced projects explore agentic workflows for automating exclusion limit extraction and Lagrangian-level model identification from collider data.

The Lunar Occultation Explorer (LOX) is a lunar-orbiting nuclear astrophysics mission that will probe the Cosmos at MeV energies.

Lunar Prospector was the third mission selected by NASA for full development and construction as part of the Discovery Program. The 19-month mission was designed for a low polar orbit investigation of the Moon, including mapping of surface composition including polar ice deposits, measurements of magnetic and gravity fields, and study of lunar outgassing events. The mission ended July 31, 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole, after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.

NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft orbited Mercury for more than four years. Among its accomplishments, the mission determined Mercury’s surface composition, revealed its geological history, discovered details about its internal magnetic field, and verified its polar deposits are dominantly water-ice. The mission ended when MESSENGER slammed into Mercury’s surface.

Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) is an important aspect of every high-energy physics experiment needed to avoid taking low-quality data. The goal of DQM is to track important information about the detector and the data and catch problems in realtime. This monitoring happens both online and offline to ensure optimal operation of the experiment. The goal of the ML4DQML project is to use machine learning to aid human shifters with identification of anomalies to help make better decisions about the quality of the data.

This project aims to develop a computational pipeline using the Contrastive Embedding for Behavioral and Neural Analysis (CEBRA) method to analyze time-locked EEG data from interacting participants.

Project PrediCT aims to increase the predictive power of NCCT CAC (coronary artery calcium) scans for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) by integrating other features alongside calcium formation and enhancing the NCCT scan itself. We are currently focusing on robustly segmenting and visualizing calcium patterns, using the Stanford COCA dataset.

QMLHEP project implements Quantum Machine Learning methods for physics analysis.

Shape optimization is an essential task in many engineering and physics domains when the geometry of an object strongly influences its performance and efficiency. The Shape optimization via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SPINN) project aims to automate and streamline the task of shape optimization via the use of Physics Informed Neural Networks and Coordinate Projection Networks.

SYMBA is an open source project researching symbolic machine learning techniques to predict the squared amplitudes and cross section for high-energy physics.

Recent success in the domain of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning has been lately a pivotal factor for development of Physics Aware and Symmetry Aware Machine Learning techniques where a model learns the symmetry of a dataset as a meta task and ends up learning the physics through the same. This project will focus on ways to learn the symmetries using semi-supervised approaches using CMS data.
