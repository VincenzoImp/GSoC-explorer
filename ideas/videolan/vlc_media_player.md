**VLC media player** (initially [VideoLAN](https://wiki.videolan.org/VideoLAN/) Client) is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats ([MPEG](https://wiki.videolan.org/MPEG/), [DivX](https://wiki.videolan.org/DivX/)/[Xvid](https://wiki.videolan.org/Xvid/), [Ogg](https://wiki.videolan.org/Ogg/), and *many* more) as well as [DVDs](https://wiki.videolan.org/DVD/), [VCDs](https://wiki.videolan.org/VCD/), and various [streaming](https://wiki.videolan.org/Stream/) protocols. However in recent years it has also become a extremely powerful server to stream live and on demand video in several formats to our network and the Internet. VLC is made by the non-profit foundation [VideoLAN](https://wiki.videolan.org/VideoLAN/).

It started as a student project at the French [École Centrale, Paris](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) but is now a worldwide project with developers from 20 countries. ([more about its history](https://wiki.videolan.org/History/)).

VLC is built in a modular way. This means that you can choose from a range of different [modules](https://wiki.videolan.org/Modules/) to decide how to [control](https://wiki.videolan.org/Interface/) VLC and how to display the [video output](https://wiki.videolan.org/Video_output/).
