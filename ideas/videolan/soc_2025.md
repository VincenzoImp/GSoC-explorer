## Introduction & Information

This page covers the [VideoLAN](https://wiki.videolan.org/VideoLAN/) program as a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/), in order to improve [VLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC/), [VLMC](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLMC/) and [dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d) (or the [libVLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC/) engine), but also the VideoLAN infrastructure and some other related projects.

We have projects in **C**, **C++**, **ASM**, **JS**, **Wasm**, **Go**, **Obj-C**, **GPU Shaders**, **C#**, **Java/Kotlin** and **Swift**.

### Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code is a way for anyone to work on open source projects and become top developers, while being paid by Google.

[VideoLAN](https://wiki.videolan.org/VideoLAN/) was a *Google Summer of Code* mentoring organization in [2007](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2007/), [2008](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2008/), [2009](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2009/), [2010](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2010/), [2011](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2011/), [2013](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2013/), [2016](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2016/), [2017](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2017/), [2018](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2018/), [2019](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2019/), [2020](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2020/), [2021](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2021/), [2022](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2022/), [2023](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2023/) and [2024](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2024/).

This page lists some ideas for Summer of Code projects on **dav1d**, **libVLC** and [VLC media player](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_media_player/), but also on *VLC infrastructure* projects.

We accept ideas also on other multimedia projects related to [VLC media player](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_media_player/).

### VLC & libVLC

[VLC media player](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_media_player/) is a cross-platform multimedia player, encoder and streamer application. It is one of the most successful open-source projects worldwide.

[VLC media player](https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_media_player/) is downloaded at an approximate monthly rate of 25 millions from the main website and that's not including third-party distributions (Linux)!

You can find more information on [VLC on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player) or on this [wiki](https://wiki.videolan.org/Main_Page/).

The engine of VLC is **libVLC**, and is used by **VLMC** and mobile versions of VLC.

### dav1d

**dav1d** is the reference AV1 decoder that is shipped inside VLC, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Windows and macOS/iOS.

It's a very low-level codec, mostly written in C and assembly.

### Summer of Code rules

If selected and developed, SoC projects for dav1d and VLC will be included in later releases.

All projects are covered by the GPL (v2+) or LGPL (v2.1+) licenses depending on the module. Projects on dav1d are BSD licensed.

The VideoLAN [Code of Conducts](https://wiki.videolan.org/CoC/) applies to all Summer projects.

## How to Start

### Find an idea

First, you need to find an idea.

This current page gives you a list of ideas. Those ideas are **NOT exhaustive**: you can bring your own idea! Some of the best ideas we've ever had were **custom** ideas!

The duration of the projects is indicative, and can be adapted, if needed.

### Submit your idea

You need to submit your idea on the *Google Summer of Code* platform.

You should do so, very quickly, even before having finished compilation and the next steps, so that we can give you early feedback.

### Compile VLC or libVLC

This may sound trivial, but it's harder than many expect. You must compile the project you want to work on.

See [https://wiki.videolan.org/Category:Building/](https://wiki.videolan.org/Category:Building/) for more informations.

You should come on [IRC](https://wiki.videolan.org/IRC/) to get help to compile.

### Provide a small patch

To demonstrate your skills, share a small patch with us. This will let you become familiar with [Git](https://wiki.videolan.org/Git/), in case you don't know it already and our process on [our gitlab](https://code.videolan.org).

### Let's get in touch

If you have a doubt, are not sure about anything or want clarification, please get in touch with us.

We have 3 major communication channels:

- Our
[mailing-lists](https://mailman.videolan.org/mailman/listinfo)to discuss patches and further development related topics; - Furthermore, we have our
[web forums](http://forum.videolan.org)for VLC-related end-user support - a VLMC section will be created once the product is published. - Finally, there is our IRC channel
*#videolan*(for libVLC) and*#vlmc*on the*libera*network. It's open to any kind of discussion. Usage issues, questions how to compile VLC/VLMC, getting to know the fellow developers, etc.

# Ideas for VLC & libVLC

## Advanced Audio Filters

**Project Description**:
We are looking for a skilled audiophile that knows a lot about audio theory and practice to work on new audio filters for VLC.

**Duration**: 350h

**Tasks to do**:

- SRS WoW like or other 3D effects;
- channels mixing, notably upmixing, like Prologic-II;
- tracks mixing, and transitions;
- scriptable new audio filters in lua and enable users to create whatever audio filtering function they want in a Lua script;
- LADSPA or other libraries integration.

**Requirements**:
This project needs some good audio knowledge and good C experience.

**Qualification task:**
Port any audio filter from MPlayer

*Proposed mentor: unidan *

## VLC Qt interface redesign

**Project Description**:
The VLC interface is quite outdated on Linux and Windows. It has a lot of features, but some are not properly exposed.

We are currently reworking the interface, but we need help.

**Duration**: 350h

**Scope of the tasks to do**:

Use the new designs shared on the mailing list, and help developping part of those, using **Qml**.

This new interface is simpler, more user friendly, and has a better "media center" feel into it.

It requires integration with the media library and with the current interface.

Qml is the technology needed to improve the current UI.

**Requirements**:
This project requires **Qt/C++** knowledge, and qml would be a nice plus.

*Proposed mentor: Pierre*

## VLC Skins2 interface update

**Project Description**:
The VLC Skins2 interface was not updated for the latest interface and core changes for the media player and playlist engine yet.

We are currently reworking the interface, but we need help.

**Duration**: 350h

**Scope of the tasks to do**:

- wayland integration
- video integration rework (like Qt interface)
- medialibrary integration

**Requirements**:
This project requires **Qt/C++** knowledge, and qml would be a nice plus.

*Proposed mentor: Pierre*

## VLC macOS interface redesign

**Project Description**:
The VLC interface is quite outdated on macOS and we are currently in the process of re-writing it to give it a modern feel, but also to integrate recent additions to libvlc regarding playback control and library management.

This project for the summer is to rework heavily this interface to make it beautiful and useful again.

**Duration**: 350h or 175h

**Scope of the tasks to do**:

There is a full design already done and tested. The major hurdle is to actually implement it the way we want it to be. The iOS/tvOS interface is simpler, more user friendly, and has a better "media center" feel into it, which influenced what we want to achieve on the Mac. Note that the objective is to use AppKit. UIKit will not be part of this project.

Iterating from the current UI and closely collaborating with the team currently working on it is a requirement.

**Requirements**:
This project requires **Obj-C** knowledge, a thorough understanding of OOP and proven previous Mac development experience. You cannot use swift for this project.

*Proposed mentor: David Fuhrmann, Felix Paul Kühne*

## VLC watchOS port

**Project Description**:
VLCKit recently added support for playback of audio files on watchOS with support for http streams coming in a future update. The idea is to create a new, standalone app for watchOS that can play local files on device with a good way to synchronize those either from a computer or the app on the companion iPhone. The UI development needs to be done in SwiftUI following the restrictions of the platform.

**Duration**: 350h

*Proposed mentor: Diogo Simao Marques, Felix Paul Kühne*

The tasks are the following:

- Review the current code
- Improve the API in Go
- Write a new Vue.js frontend

Those will be done in **Go** and **JS**

**Duration**: 350h

*Proposed mentor: David and j-b*

# Ideas for dav1d

## dav1d RISC-V optimizations

Improving the performance of the AV1 decoder is very important for VLC and the whole ecosystem.

It requires to:

- Understand of RISC-V assembly
- Understand a bit what a video decoder is
- Write RISC-V functions

**Requirements**: This project requires **C** and **ASM** knowledge, as well as system programming skills

**Duration**: 175h

Contact 'j-b'

## dav1d GPU Compute Shaders

Improving the performance of the AV1 decoder is very important for VLC and the whole ecosystem.

This project requires to port one of the filter, like SGR or Wiener to one of the Shader languages. iPhones or Xbox One would be a good target.

This is a tricky project, but is doable during the summer

**Duration**: 350h

**Requirements**: This project requires **C** and **GPU Shaders** knowledge, as well as system programming skills

Contact 'j-b'

## dav1d statistics extractions

The [dav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d) AV1 decoder is a new high performance AV1 decoder by
VideoLAN.

Current open source tools for AV1 analysis use instrumentation in the reference decoder [libaom](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom) to extract decode-time metadata for display and reporting, but support for sophisticated analysis is lacking.

To speed development of AV1 tools like the rav1e, it would be helpful to add similar decoder metadata extraction APIs to the dav1d decoder so that rapid testing of encoder algorithms is easier. This includes the ability to quickly produce statistics, visualizations and other reporting that can be used for tuning encoder parameters or guiding development. Advanced ideas include adding similar encoder metadata API to rav1e that add encode-time visualizations.

**Requirements**: This project requires **C** knowledge.

**Duration**: 175h

# Ideas for libplacebo

## Direct3D 11 backend

**Project Description:**

libplacebo uses a GPU abstraction with a number of backends. The goal would be to add a new backend based on Direct3D 11, since Vulkan and OpenGL support on Windows are often of limited quality, especially for older hardware.

Lots of example code for how this implementation would look can be found [as part of the mpv project ](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/video/out/d3d11/ra_d3d11.c).

Large parts can be copy/pasted and adapted to the libplacebo API.

**Tasks to do:**

- Add a new `pl_gpu` backend based on Direct3D 11
- Integration into the build system, test framework and CI infrastructure

**Requirements:**

- Knowledge of
**C**as well as, ideally, graphics API fundamentals. (But the latter can be learned as part of the project) - Ability to develop and test on Windows

**Duration**: 175h

## Dolby Vision Profile 5 (IPT-PQ)

**Project Description:**

Dolby IPT-PQ is a HDR color space similar to ITU-R ICtCp, but with proprietary Dolby modifications (reshaping algorithm). Your goal is to implement this reshaper in the form of a GLSL shader, using knowledge from known Dolby patents and dumped headers.

**Tasks to do:**

- Figure out, and (if necessary) reverse engineer the stream format for the Dolby reshaping algorithm described in several of their patents.
- Implement this algorithm in GLSL
- Integration into libplacebo (optional)
- Test against reference implementations of Dolby Vision profile 5

**Requirements:**

- Knowledge of
**GLSL**and**C**. Knowledge of colorspaces in general is an obvious plus, but the theory here is not important - only the implementation. - (Possibly) Ability to reverse engineer any still-unknown or differing-from-patents parts of the stream headers.

Knowledge of libplacebo internals is not required, since the skeleton code for this already exists - what's missing is the reshaping algorithm.

**Duration**: 350h

Contact 'haasn'

## GPU motion interpolation (mvtools)

**Project Description**

Your goal is to develop GPU shaders for motion-adaptive frame interpolation in the style of [mvtools](https://wiki.videolan.org/SoC_2025/[https:/github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-mvtools](https:/github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-mvtools)).

This is an open-ended project. If not completed, any progress towards this goal is good enough.

**Sub-goals:**

- Recreate the motion vector search algorithms from MAnalyze
- Implement the pixel masking and pixel flow algorithms from MFlowFps

These can be tackled and complete out-of-order.

**Requirements:**

- Good knowledge of both C and GLSL, especially compute shaders and other GPGPU techniques. (CUDA or OpenCL skills also transfer, though the shader will have to be GLSL)
- Ideally, general knowledge of video processing techniques (e.g. motion vector search) - at least enough to be able to understand what mvtools code is doing.

**Duration**: 350h
