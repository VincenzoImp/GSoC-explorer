# Opportunities

Every year, QC-Devs participates in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [MITACS Globalink](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink) programs. These programs provide an excellent opportunity for students to contribute to open-source projects, gain valuable experience, and collaborate with mentors in the field of quantum chemistry and computational science.
We welcome students from all backgrounds and skill levels to apply. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, there are opportunities for you to contribute to our projects and learn from our mentors.
See [QC-Devs Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://www.gsocorganizations.dev/organization/qc-devs/),
[QC-Devs Google Winter of Code (WOC)](https://winter-of-code.tech/orgsPage/qcdevs), and [MITACS Globalink](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink) for more information.
