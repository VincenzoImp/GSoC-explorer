[Google Summer of Code 2026
](https://qcdevs.org//join/qcdevs_gsoc/)

This document provides guidance for individuals interested in participating in the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program with QC-Devs. We are looking forward to your contributions.

## Project Ideas

We store project ideas as GitHub issues. The below links refer to these issues, where you can find more information
about the package, the project, the task, and the expected outcomes. While QC-Devs supports quite a few packages (we released 9 in the last
18 months!), each year we select a few to focus on, as this makes it easier for mentors to engage with
participants. In keeping with this year’s GSoC emphasis on AI, we also included a [project related to AI/ML](https://github.com/theochem/Selector/issues/285).
