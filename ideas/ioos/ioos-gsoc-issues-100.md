## [GSoC Project Proposal]: Enhance NOS skill assessment package’s user and developer experience

**Labels:** project idea, GSoC26

### Project Description

The National Ocean Service (NOS) is currently developing a Python package to assess the skill of their [Operational Forecast Systems (OFS)](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/models.html). The goal of this project is to work with the NOS team and improve the skill assessment package by:

- Enhancing the user experience by expanding the existing graphical user interface (GUI) and adding a visualization dashboard that displays results, and
- Expanding automated GitHub testing, debugging, and other code development tools used in the code development workflow.

### Expected Outcomes

- In addition to the existing command line interface, the enhanced GUI will increase package accessibility and flexibility by allowing visual selection of all run modes, software input arguments, and options.  
- The improved visualization dashboard will provide users of the package’s outputs a one-stop shop to access package output and visualizations. 
- Expanding the GitHub automated testing options will let code contributors more rapidly and robustly test code changes, save time reviewing code, and reduce the incidence of bugs.


### Skills Required
