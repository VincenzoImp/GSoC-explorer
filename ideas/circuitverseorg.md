## Project 1: Structured Format for Saved Circuit Data

**Duration:** 175 – 350 hours  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Technologies:** Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, JSON

Currently, CircuitVerse stores circuits as unstructured JSON objects where components are serialized based on placement order rather than logical hierarchy. As a result, two logically identical circuits can produce entirely different saved files. This makes the data unsuitable for advanced use cases such as Verilog generation, robust version control, circuit diffing, and large-scale machine learning or LLM-based analysis.

This project aims to design and implement a **structured, canonical data format** for saving circuits. The new format should be deterministic, logically consistent, and independent of visual layout. Circuits will be represented as ordered netlists or graph-based structures, enabling future features such as automated synthesis, AI-assisted circuit design, and semantic comparisons between circuits.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Canonical, deterministic representation of circuits
* Logical netlist-based serialization independent of placement order
* Backward compatibility with existing circuit files

**Additional Features:**

* **Human-Readable Schema:** Define a strict JSON schema for easier debugging and manual inspection.
* **Visual–Logic Separation:** Decouple logical connectivity from visual metadata (x, y coordinates, canvas layout).
* **Idempotent Converter:** Build a migration tool to convert legacy `.cv` files into the new standardized format without data loss.

**Learning Path:**

* JSON Schema design and validation
* CircuitVerse simulator internals (serialization of `CircuitElement`)
* Graph Theory: Graph isomorphism and canonical graph representations
* EDA standards such as SPICE and EDIF for inspiration
