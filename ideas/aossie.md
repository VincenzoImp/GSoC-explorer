# AOSSIE's Idea List for Google Summer of Code 2026

As an umbrella organization since its inception 10 years ago, AOSSIE's projects have evolved mostly independently from each other. More recently, we have started a deliberate effort to group these projects by theme and skillset and to ensure that knowledge and mentorship propagates efficiently across projects of the same themes and with the same skillset. This year we are taking another step in this direction with the introduction of org-wide ideas.


* [Project-Specific Ideas, Grouped by Theme](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Info/blob/main/GSoC-Ideas/2026/index.md#project-specific-ideas-grouped-by-theme)
* [Organization-Wide Ideas](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Info/blob/main/GSoC-Ideas/2026/index.md#organization-wide-ideas)


## Project-Specific Ideas, Grouped by Theme and Tagged by Skillset

Project-specific ideas are ideas where the contributor is expected to focus on a single project, while taking care of all aspects of the project. These ideas are suitable for contributors who are generalists and interested in using all technical competence areas required by the project.

The skillset needed in each idea is shown in brackets.

We are open to proposals that fit into our general themes, even if they don't fit exactly the ideas that are currently listed above. However, if you have such a proposal, discuss it with mentors and other contributors publicly in Discord firstly.


## Organization-Wide Ideas

Org-wide ideas are ideas where a single contributor will contribute to many of our projects, but focusing on a single aspect in every project. These ideas are particularly suitable for contributors who prefer to specialize in a single technical competence area and who have the soft skills to interact effectively with contributors and mentors from many projects.
