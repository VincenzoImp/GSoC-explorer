# Google Summer of Code & Outreachy Project Ideas

Welcome to Konflux's wiki tracking Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy project ideas!

This page serves as a central hub for prospective contributors interested in working with our organization through these invaluable open-source programs. Here you'll find a curated list of project ideas that align with our goals and provide exciting opportunities for skill development and contribution to our projects.

## How to Apply

You're likely here because you're already familiar with Google Summer of Code and Outreachy and are eager to explore our project ideas and learn how to get in touch. If, however, you're new to these programs, we recommend starting with their official websites:

* [Google Summer of Code Official Website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
* [Outreachy Official Website](https://www.outreachy.org/)

Once you're familiar with the program rules and guidelines, the next step is simple: contact the project idea mentors directly OR even better, feel free to **drop us an email on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/konflux)—you'd be most welcome there.** We encourage you to start exploring our project ideas and getting in touch early, because as you know, time flies :-) !
