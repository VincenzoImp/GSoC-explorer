Building the Amharic DBpedia Language Chapter with Large Language Models (LLMs)

Description

DBpedia is a collaborative initiative that extracts structured information from Wikipedia and publishes it as Linked Open Data. This is a continuation of GSoC 2024 and GSoC 2025. We successfully integrated Amharic parsers and extractors into the DBpedia chapter. However, due to time constraints, we could not build a complete automation system to extract and build the artifacts. In this year’s GSOC, we would like to continue from last year’s progress.

Goal

The primary goal of this project is to enhance the existing Amharic DBpedia[ chapter](https://dice-group.github.io/Amharic_DBpedia_Chapter):

- Integrate an automatic extraction framework and mapping by applying LLMs
- Class/Property/Relation prediction

- Build a demo page
- Update the home page
- Deploy the knowledge graph available to end users via a web page.
- Create documentation for processes, tools, and techniques used for sustainable development, following FAIR principles.

Impact

- Enable users to access and utilize structured data in Amharic DBpedia more effectively.
- This will promote linguistic diversity and support research, education, and applications that rely on multilingual knowledge graphs.
- NLP downstream tasks: Apply knowledge graphs from DBpedia to NLP applications such as machine translation and sentiment analysis.
- Community engagement: Encourage the community to contribute and collaborate to sustain and expand Amharic DBpedia.
