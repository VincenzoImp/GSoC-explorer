Next Steps for Mentors

- Get yourselves signed up as mentors ASAP on the
[GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Contact[@r0bby](https://forums.librehealth.io/u/r0bby)if you need an invite. - Please review the
[GSoC Mentor’s Manual](http://archive.flossmanuals.net/gsocmentoring/)as it goes over everything you need to do and how to evaluate proposals. - Refine your project descriptions and be ready to respond to student questions in a timely manner. There is a feedback loop that should happen. The best contributors will be refining their proposals over time.
- During the program,
**ALL****communication must be public. Failure to do so will not end well**. We will be detailing how violations will be handled a bit later. This will, however, be strictly enforced, but each case will be given consideration as to whether or not private communication was necessary. - Double-check and make sure you’re in the
[@mentors](https://forums.librehealth.io/groups/mentors)groups here on the forums. If not, send a direct message to[@mentors](https://forums.librehealth.io/groups/mentors)and let us know!
