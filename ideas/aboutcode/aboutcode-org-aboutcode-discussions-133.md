Subject: Introduction: Systems student (CodeSeer project) interested in Parsing & ScanCode Hi everyone, My name is Raj Shekhar, and I’m a student at Delhi Technological University. I’m writing to introduce myself for GSoC 2026. I am interested in ScanCode Toolkit because it aligns closely with my current work. I am developing an open-source code intelligence engine called CodeSeer (focused on parsing and understanding software composition), so I have been diving deep into static analysis and AST parsing recently. I’ve successfully set up ScanCode Toolkit locally and ran it against my own project to compare its license detection with my internal logic. The setup process on Windows was a bit tricky with path lengths (encountered the package_patterns_index cache corruption issue but resolved it), but I was impressed by the scan speed once configured. I’m looking through the issue tracker now for good-first-issues related to parsers or rule improvements. Looking forward to contributing! |
