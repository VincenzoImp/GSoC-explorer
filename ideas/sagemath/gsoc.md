# Google Summer of Code with SageMath

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

Originally created as a program for (university) students, [since 2022](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/11/google-summer-of-code-2024-celebrating-20th-year.html), Google Summer of Code has been open to **students** and to **beginners in open source software development** that are over the age of 18 at time of registration.

SageMath has participated in GSoC as a mentoring organization since 2008, and was again selected for participation in the 2024 program.

Prospective GSoC Contributors for the 2024 program should view [the SageMath GSoC Contributor Application Guidelines](https://wiki.sagemath.org/GSoC/Contributors), which has all relevant information.

All final applications will need to be submitted through [Google's Summer of Code webpage](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
