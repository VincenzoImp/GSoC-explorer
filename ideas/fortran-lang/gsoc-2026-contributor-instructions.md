## Application process

<!-- TODO: edit Disoucse GSoC-2024 link -->

1. Join the [Fortran-Lang Discourse](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/) and introduce yourself at the [#GSoC-2026](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/google-summer-of-code-2026/10674/2) thread.

   - The discourse is a great place to get to know the community and for us to get to know you.
   - Importantly, you can ask questions about your project idea and application, and get feedback from the community
   - When introducing yourself, please provide information about:
     - your familiarity with Fortran and other programming languages;
     - your background and any particular expertise (physics, engineering, _etc._);
     - any particular algorithmic interests or experience you have;
     - any other relevant information (_e.g._ geographic location, native language).

2. Have a look at the Fortran-Lang and affiliated projects and familiarize yourself with their contributor guides

   - [Fortran Standard Library (stdlib)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib)
   - [Fortran Package Manager (fpm)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
   - [LFortran](https://lfortran.org/)
   - [Fortran Language Server (fortls)](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortls)
   - [Modern Fortran for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/fortran-lang/vscode-fortran-support)
   - [Fortran website](https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage)
   - [fftpack](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack)
   - [minpack](https://github.com/fortran-lang/minpack)

3. Review the [project ideas](https://github.com/fortran-lang/webpage/wiki/GSoC-2026-Project-ideas) page and look for any projects that interest you.

4. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one and submit at least one patch to a Fortran-Lang project alongside your application. See [patch requirement](#patch-requirement) for more details.

5. Develop your application and submit it to Google by **the deadline April 8 - 18:00 UTC**. See [application template](#student-application-template) for more details.

## Patch requirement

Submit at least one pull request into any of the following repositories:

- [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
- [stdlib](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib)
- [LFortran](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran)
- [fortls](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fortls)
- [vscode-fortran-support](https://github.com/fortran-lang/vscode-fortran-support)
- [fftpack](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fftpack)
- [minpack](https://github.com/fortran-lang/minpack)
- [test-drive](https://github.com/fortran-lang/test-drive)

To do so, create a GitHub account if you don't have one already, fork the repository, clone it using git onto your local computer, add your modification to the code, commit, push into your fork, and create a pull request. We will review it; please respond to reviews. The pull request must be merged. List all your pull requests (merged and open) in your application. If you have contributed to any of the projects before, please list that as well.

If you need help with git and/or setting any of these projects up, please ask us at the Fortran Discourse. We will be happy to help.

Good luck, and we look forward to your application!
