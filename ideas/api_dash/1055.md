|
We welcome the responsible use of AI tools (e.g., code assistants, LLMs, copilots) to improve productivity, learning, and developer experience. However, contributors are fully accountable for all submitted work. ## Acceptable Use- AI tools may be used for
**ideation, refactoring, debugging, new feature code generation, documentation, and test generation**. - AI can assist in exploring, but must not replace understanding.
## Contributor Responsibility**You must understand the code you submit.** Do not contribute AI-generated code you cannot explain, maintain, or debug.- All contributions
**must meet the same review bar as human-written code**. **You are responsible for correctness, security, performance, and maintainability**, regardless of how the code was produced.- Ensure your contributions comply with our project's license.
- Do
**not**submit AI-generated content that may:- Reproduce copyrighted or proprietary code
- Violate third-party licenses
- Include text or code with unclear provenance
- When in doubt, rewrite the code in your own words or consult maintainers.
- Review AI-assisted code for:
- Hidden bugs or incorrect assumptions
- Security vulnerabilities
- Inconsistent style or architectural violations
- If a contribution is AI-assisted,
**mentioning it in the PR description**is encouraged, especially for large or complex changes. - You are prohibited from:
- Blindly copying AI output without review
- Using AI to bypass project guidelines, reviews, or contributor responsibilities
