## API Explorer

#### Tell us about the task you want to perform and are unable to do so because the feature is not available

This project is designed to enhance the API Dash user experience by integrating a curated library of popular and publicly available APIs. This feature allows users to discover, browse, search, and directly import API endpoints into their workspace for seamless testing and exploration. Developers can access pre-configured API request templates, complete with authentication details, sample payloads, and expected responses. This eliminates the need to manually set up API requests, reducing onboarding time and improving efficiency. APIs spanning various domains—such as AI, finance, weather, and social media—are organized into categories, making it easy for users to find relevant services. You are required to develop the entire process backend in the form of an automation pipeline which parses OpenAPI/HTML files, auto-tag it to relevant category, enrich the data, create templates. You can also add features such as user ratings, reviews, and community contributions (via GitHub) to ensure accurate and up-to-date resources.
