## General information

This wiki page will be the central point for information about the [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://opensource.googleblog.com/) at Debian.

Google Summer of Code is a program where Google pays students and beginner contributors stipends to work over the summer on free software projects such as Debian. Each contributor works with one or more mentors from the community to complete a software project.

Debian is planning to apply as mentoring organization for 2026! We want to make the experience even more exciting and fulfilling this year for the contributors, the mentors and the whole Debian community this year, so please join us!

## Guidelines for GSoC Projects in Debian

Our mentors are required to provide prospective contributors with some small (i.e. that can be accomplished in at most a few hours) task related to the proposed project. This will help both the mentor and contributor decide if they are a suitable match for each other and the project. In the case that the Debian GSoC team has to rank projects, the results of this small task will also help give confidence in a project-mentor-contributor matchup.

The proposed project should also follow some rules:

- All proposed projects must directly relate to Debian and fit into the pre-existing work of a Debian team
- All projects must have at least one mentor with a formal affiliation to the Debian project ie a DD. We encourage to have at least one co-mentor who can be a debian contributor.
- Mentors are only mentors for one project (That applies to mentors and co-mentors)

Note: the deadline to propose projects is February 03 2026.
