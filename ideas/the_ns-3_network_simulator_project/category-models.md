Main documentation for models is [ns-3 model library](http://www.nsnam.org/docs/models/html/index.html).

The pages in this category describe various models for ns-3, both those included in main distribution and those that aren't. Pages usually provide information such as general info, tips and tricks, installation inforamtion etc. Most of the time, the information provided here complements official documentation (if any) and doesn't serve as a reference; one should look into model library linked above for that.
