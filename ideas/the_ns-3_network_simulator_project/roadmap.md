ns-3 is a community-driven project, and as such, we cannot typically make guarantees about the availability of new or improved code; our maintainers work largely on a best-effort basis. However, we use this page to describe our goals (time-permitting) for each release, and where we broadly are trying to steer the project for the future.

## ns-3.44 plans

The most up-to-date listing of items being worked on in this release cycle can be seen by browsing [Merge requests](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&milestone_title=ns-3.44) and [Issues](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&milestone_title=ns-3.44) in the GitLab.com tracker that are tagged with the 'Milestone ns-3.44' tag.

Besides this, the following [ns-3 maintainers](https://www.nsnam.org/about/governance/maintainers/) announced plans to work on the following topics:

- Stefano Avallone plans to finally finalize the EMLSR support and possibly to introduce the (legacy) PowerSave mode support.

- Sebastien Deronne plans to work on Wi-Fi module extensions for GCR (UR & BA), improved support for P2P/adhoc, and 802.11be extensions (CCA, RAAs, 320 MHz BW, …)

- Alberto Gallegos is working on merging a new
[Zigbee model](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/merge_requests/1004), improving documentation of the lr-wpan and energy modules, revise[TraceSources](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/doxygen/de/de5/_trace_source_list.html)of the lr-wpan module, and convert many constants specified in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard into changeable[Attributes](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/doxygen/d3/d79/_attribute_list.html).
