The project coordinates a few summer coding programs in which student developers are paired with mentors to produce code over the summer.

# ns-3 Summer of Code 2022

ns-3 Summer of Code (NSoC) is a program that runs in parallel to Google Summer of Code. Unlike GSoC, it is not funded, but we aim to operate it similarly to GSoC.

**Chandrakant Jena,***Ping and Ping6 Enhancements for ns-3:*mentored by Tommaso Pecorella and Tom Henderson[project wiki page](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/NSOC2022Ping)

The project by Chandrakant was completed successfully in December 2022, with six commits made to ns-3-dev starting with [commit da107e04](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/commit/da107e04eeb0c12631eadda6a30ad1a33b7f0931). The project added a ** new Ping application**, helper class, example program, unit test, and

For reference, below were the 2021 project ideas and the 2021 student guide:

# ns-3 Summer of Code 2021

ns-3 Summer of Code (NSoC) is a program that runs in parallel to Google Summer of Code. Unlike GSoC, it is not funded, but we aim to operate it similarly to GSoC. The commitments are similar; students and mentors are expected to define and work towards a mergeable project goal by the end of the summer. The program is offered to 'honorable mention' GSoC proposals (i.e., proposals that we would have selected had we received more student slots from Google) and for other reasons such as a contributor's ineligibility for GSoC.

**Nitya Chandra,***Enable IPv6 support for ad-hoc routing protocols in ns-3:*[project wiki page](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/NSOC2021Ipv6)**Note: project did not complete**

# Google Summer of Code 2020

## Background

Below is some information that was used during the application phase.

# European Space Agency Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS) 2016

ns-3 had one student (Michael Di Perna) successfully complete the 2016 [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis/).

[Project page](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/SOCIS2016)for Optical Satellite Systems project[Project Ideas page](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/SOCIS2016Projects#Project_Ideas)

# Mentored summer projects 2016

ns-3 maintainers will mentor additional summer projects (that students will work on using their own sources of funding) on a best-effort basis. Students interested in this option should review the GSoC or SOCIS ideas page, or propose their own.

# Google Summer of Code 2016

ns-3 was not selected for the 2016 [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). We mentored two summer projects outside of GSoC. Below were our materials prepared for our GSoC organizational application.

# Google Summer of Code 2015

ns-3 was selected to participate in the 2015 [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015). More information can be found on our Project Ideas page and our Student Guide.

This year's students were announced on April 27, and all four successfully completed the program:

- Melchiorre Danilo Abrignani,
[Carrier Aggregation support for the LTE module](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2015LTECA) - Matthieu Coudron,
[Implementing multipath TCP (MPTCP) in ns3](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2015MpTcpImplementation) - Natale Patriciello,
[TCP layer refactoring with automated test on RFC compliance and validation](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2015TCPTest) - Vishwesh Rege,
[802.15.4 realistic MAC and Energy Model](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/GSOC2015LrWpanMac)

# European Space Agency Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS) 2015

ns-3 has been accepted to the 2015 [ESA Summer of Code in Space](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2015/). The ns-3 project had one student in SOCIS in each of 2013, 2014 and 2015. However, the satellite channel models project for 2015 [ Satellite channel models](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/SOCIS2015) did not successfully complete.

# Mentored summer projects

ns-3 maintainers will mentor additional summer projects (that students will work on using their own sources of funding) on a best-effort basis. Students interested in this option should review the GSoC or SOCIS ideas page, or propose their own.

We have one such mentored project in 2015:

- Saswat Mishra,
[Neighbor Discovery enhancements](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/NeighborDiscoveryProject)
