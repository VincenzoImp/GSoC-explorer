## GNU Aris

GNU Aris is a logical proof program that supports propositional and predicate logic, as well as Boolean algebra and arithmetical logic, in the form of abstract sequences. Aris uses a predefined set of inference and equivalence rules, but allows the user to reference older proofs, including proofs done in Isar. Aris uses standard logical symbols, and a natural deduction interface, making it easy for beginners to work with.
