**Note:** these are just the ideas of one person. It may not necessarily
  coincide with the ideas of others in the community.

**Note:** For GSoC, it doesn't have to be this way. On the contrary, we
  welcome the participants to describe their own ideas.

* [Definitions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/UD-series-definitions)
In order to clarify the discussions about Taylor series and asymptotic expansions, it is necessary to define the relevant concepts as precisely as possible.

* [Current situation and applications](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/UD-series-situation)
In this section there is description of application of series, current situation and other issues.

* [Current power series with poly ring](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/master/sympy/polys/ring_series.py)

Mario Pernici's current implementation of power series in SymPy with poly rings.

* [Lpoly2 Distributed polynomials in series.](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/609)
Mario Pernici pull request.

* [Sequences and formal power series prototype](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/UD-Sequences-and-formal-power-series-prototype)

* [Road-map](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/UD-series-roadmap) future plans.

* (depricated) [User interface](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/UD-series-user-interface) At this page we will be concentrated to the end-user's aims of series usage.
