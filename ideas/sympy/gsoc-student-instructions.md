These are the steps to follow for applying to GSoC with SymPy:

1. Go through our [Introduction to Contributing](https://docs.sympy.org/dev/contributing/introduction-to-contributing.html) page to see how to get started developing SymPy.
2. Review our [[ideas page|GSoC Ideas]] to see if you find a project that is interesting to you.
3. You will need to create an account on GitHub and submit at least one pull request to SymPy along with your application. See the [instructions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC-Application-Template#patch-requirement) on the application template.
4. Please make sure your application follows the [[template|GSoC Application Template]].
5. **The application deadline is March 31 18:00 UTC**. Google will not accept late applications for any reason, so get them in there. There have been issues in the past with submissions right up at the
deadline, so submit your application early. You will be able to edit your application up until the deadline, so if you have a draft, submit it now, and update it as you modify it.

If you have any other questions, first check if they are answered in
the [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq). Then you can ask on the
[SymPy list](http://groups.google.com/group/sympy). The Python Software Foundation has
another [good
FAQ](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/FrequentlyAskedQuestions) to
read before asking questions.
