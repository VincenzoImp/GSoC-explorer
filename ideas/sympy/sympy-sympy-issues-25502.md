## Solved Problems to tackle using State Space class

**Labels:** GSoC

These are some solved problems which `sympy` could be able to solve using the State Space Models. The purpose here is to demonstrate the usefulness of #25473 and the methods which are being added.

1. Frequency Response of Spring Mass Damping system.

2. Deriving State Space Model from physical systems.
Example - State Space Representation of an electrical cirucit - https://www.javatpoint.com/control-system-state-space-model
