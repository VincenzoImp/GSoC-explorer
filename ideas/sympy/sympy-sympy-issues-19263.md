## [Feature Request] Scatter plots support

**Labels:** plotting

While working on #19073 for adding wrapper of plotting in `stats` module to plot `density` and `cdf` of the random variables, I found that the `plot` function works good with the continuous random variable but to plot FRV and DRV, it will be good to have scatter plots available in `plotting`, so as to allow discrete plots as [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Poisson_pmf.svg/325px-Poisson_pmf.svg.png)
