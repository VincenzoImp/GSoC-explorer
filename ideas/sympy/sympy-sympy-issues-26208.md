## Asymptotic series expansions for Shi & Chi functions

**Labels:** series

Though the limits work for most general points, these limits can also work more simply through gruntz if we have asymptotic series expansions. Currently we have none 
```
>>> Shi(x).series(x, oo)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...................
sympy.core.function.PoleError:
Asymptotic expansion of Shi around [oo] is not implemented.
>>>
>>> Chi(x).series(x, oo)
Traceback (most recent call last):
.................
sympy.core.function.PoleError:
Asymptotic expansion of Chi around [oo] is not implemented.
```
