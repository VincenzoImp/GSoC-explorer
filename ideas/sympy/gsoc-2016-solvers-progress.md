## Meeting Schedule

### Meeting #01
* Date: 2nd May, 2016
* Time: 6:30 PM - 7:15 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak
###### Minutes of Meeting:
  - Plans for the Community Bonding Period  
Shekhar will remain busy during this period as his college examinations start from Thursday, the 5th of May.  His examinations are expected to end by the 14th of May, and he will be up and running then.  Meanwhile, Kshitij has no upcoming exams and will be contributing full time from Sunday 8th May 2016.

  - Splitting the project  
We both had proposed to work on a few similar topics in our proposals.     
As there is a lot of task that's needed to be done, Amit suggested us to split the project among ourselves.  
    Currently, our two main priorities are implementing the following:
      * Univariate Transcendental equation solver
      * Solving multivariate equations  

      Due to his impending exams, Shekhar suggested that he would like to work on the system of nonlinear multivariate equations.  
      On the other hand, Kshitij will look into the old transcendental equations solver - `tsolve`. The motive is to devise ways to develop a modularized and extensible method for handling such equations.

  - Gitter Channel  
Amit stressed on the point to make every discussion open to the community for their reviews and guidance. To that end, Kshitij suggested creating a dedicated Gitter channel. After some deliberation, it was decided to create a public Gitter channel specifically for discussion on the Solvers project. Amit took the  responsibility for doing the same. 

* Goals for Shekhar:
  - Look into implementing a system of multivariate equation solver using `solve_poly_system`.
  - _Deadline_: Monday 23rd May 2016

* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Set up a blog as soon as possible.
  - Audit `tsolve` in the old solver.
  - Read the [paper](http://www.apmaths.uwo.ca/~djeffrey/Offprints/W-adv-cm.pdf) on LambertW function for developing a deeper understanding.
  - _Deadline_ : Friday 13th May 2016

Pull Requests to review (all): 
  - [PR #10751](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10751)@kshitij10496: To be reviewed by @aktech
  - [PR #10733](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10733)@Shekharrajak: To be reviwed by @kshitij10496

### Meeting #02
* Date: Sunday 15 May, 2016 
* Time: 10:00 - 11:00AM (IST)
* Attendees: Harsh Gupta, Amit Kumar, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

Shekhar is starting working on Non Linear System of Equations using `solve_poly_system`(works pretty well).If there is some symbols that can't be solved using `solve_poly_system` solve them using known results(substitution method [Link1](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/syseqgen5.htm), [link3](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/syseqgen6.htm) ) or use this method [Link3](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~aleykin3/math4803spr13/BOOK/chapter1.pdf) (Page 9 : 2.2 example) .

Kshitij is working on `_tsolve`. He is posting blog about his idea and implementation part by tonight.

* Goals for Shekhar:
  - Implementing system of Non linear equations solver using `solve_poly_system`.
  - _Deadline_: before Thursday:19 May 2016 (PR to be send by tonight- 15 May)

### Meeting #03
* Date: 22nd May 2016
* Time: 11:00 AM - 12:15 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:
The meeting started with Kshitij presenting his work in the [PR#11141](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pulls/11141) : the `solve_decomposition` method. 

Here are the issues discussed in the meeting:

1. Handling an `EmptySet` returned by `solveset`  
This is a design issue with two possible approaches:
  - Returning a `ConditionSet` object stating that this method cannot solve the equation.
  - Returning an `EmptySet` object - specifying that no solutions exist for such an equation.  
Test cases: `1/ln(x)` and `1/tan(x)`.  
Harsh suggested that including the infinities(both `S.Infinity` and `S.NegativeInfinity`) in the real domain would be useful for this case and for the overall development of `solveset`.

2. Finding the range of a function  
Sometimes, the range of a function can be used to decide whether an equation is solvable or not.  
There is no explicit functionality for determining the range in SymPy.  
For instance, solving for `x` in `cos(x) = 2` should have no solution.   
As a result, an `EmptySet` object is expected. However, current implementation cannot achieve this.
A possible technique to calculate the range consist of:
  1. Determining the inverse image of the function (if possible) 
  2. Find the domain of the inverted function. 
For this, Amit suggested the use of the `not_empty_in` function.  

3. Intersection of an `ImageSet` with an `Interval`  
Following the determination of the range of the function (an `Interval` object), we will need to determine what values satisfy the equation. The ability to compute the intersection of an `ImageSet` with an `Interval` will be needed.  
Harsh shared an idea of solving this issue as follows:
   1. Extract the `Lambda` function of the `ImageSet`.
   2. Invert the expression of this `Lambda` function for the boundary values of `Interval` object.
   3. These values are used to define a new `Interval` object.
   4. Take the intersection of the `base_set` of the `ImageSet` with the new `Interval` object.
   5. Substitute these values back into the original `Lambda` function to obtain the intersection set.


This was followed by a discussion on the implementation of `nlinsolve` and a method for solving equations for non-symbols. [PR#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111). 

Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

1. About the [PR#11128](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11128) : The PR was not really necessary for solveset right now.

2.[PR#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) `nlinsolve` method was partially created. Remaining part is substitution method(when equations poly and non polynomial) and positive dimensional system.

Shekhar is trying to get solution from `groebner basis` for positive dimensional system.

In substitution method, solveset is used in some steps to solve for individual symbols. So solveset may return Intersection/Imageset

example : 

        In [ ]: solveset(z + exp(2*x) - sin(y),x,S.Reals)
        Out[ ]: (-∞, ∞) ∩ {log(-(z - sin(y)))}


so if we want to check unsolved symbols in the solution then need to check imageset/intersection.


* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Write a blog post on `solve_decomposition`
  - Read about the Extended Reals and document the pros and cons of its implementation.
  - Develop a method for finding the range of a function.
  - Implement the intersection technique of an `ImageSet` with an `Interval`

* Goals for Shekhar:
  - Edit blog with proper implementation and problems he is facing.
  - Work on positive dimensional system solver, substitution method.

At the end, Wednesday, 25th May was decided to be the date of the next meeting.
Time to code !

### Meeting #04
* Date: 26 May, 2016
* Time: 7:30 PM - 8:45 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion : 

  - [PR #11149](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11149) : A very brief review of the PR and its importance in handling intersection operation of certain sets (`Integers`, `Naturals`) with `Intervals`.
  - [PR #11164](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11164) : Extended discussion on the various cases of the technique implemented in this PR. A particular, interesting case is that of handling complex values returned after inverting the `Lambda` expression. As only real-valued intervals exist, the way of handling the complex values was discussed.
  - ***Range***: The `not_empty_in` method cannot be used for our purpose here. We will have to implement a new method here. For this, Harsh and Amit suggested researching the mailing list and previous discussions for ideas. 


* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Implement the feature of handling complex values in PR#11164
  - Read about the possible ways to implement the range of a function

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

  - `nlinsolve` [PR#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) currently it returns solution in same order as the symbols are given for zero dimensional system. But in positive dimensional system and substitution method returns solution is not in same order and also replace `Dict` with tuple in final solution.

- Trigonometric Inequality solver is not giving solution in general form. ex:

```
In [4]: solveset(2*sin(x)-1<0, x, S.Reals)
Out[4]: 
⎛    π⎞   ⎛5⋅π   ⎞
⎜-∞, ─⎟ ∪ ⎜───, ∞⎟
⎝    6⎠   ⎝ 6    ⎠

```

We can generalize this to  `(2*π*n - 7*π/6) < x < (2*π*n + π/6)`.

* Goals for Shekhar:

  - Make `nlinsolve` free from `Dict` and update the blog.
  - Search more about trigonometric inequalities.


### Meeting #05
* Date: 29 May, 2016
* Time: 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion : 
 For finding the range of a function, Amit suggested looking into the [PRs#2723](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2723) and [PR#2925](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/2925).
Also, [PR#11164](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11164) is up for review and Amit will try to review it before the next meeting.

* Goals for Kshitij:
- Try to implement a method for finding the range of a function in a given domain.



* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

  - Shekhar was trying to get extended solution for Trigonometric inequality. For that we need to find domain of the
expression. We have to check mainly` sqrt` and denominators. Expressions inside `sqrt` should be greater than zero and `denominator expression = 0` solution should be excluded from the overall domain. We can use `decompogen` to get domain.

  - `nlinsolve` `XFAIL` case `test_issue_2777` was failing because there is need of checking whether solution is making denom = 0. If yes then remove that solution. Need little improvement for these cases.

  - There is comparison error for one [test case](https://travis-ci.org/sympy/sympy/jobs/134354310#L3763). Amit will try to check that comparison error.
 
* Goals for Shekhar:

  - Improve `nlinsolve` https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111 
  - Work on Trigonometric equation/Inequality solver.



### Meeting #06
* Date: 5 June, 2016
* Time:  6:00 - 7:00 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion :
  - Discussion on the design of the methods(`function_range` and `continuous_in`) for finding the range of a function.
  - Instead of using the `singularities` function, we are using the general way of finding the singularities.
  - Also, we will deal with domain constraints in case of `sqrt` and `log` functions.

* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Brush up the [PR#11224](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11224) for review.


* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

  - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) simplified general solution: Found some cases like
`2*sin(x) - 2*sqrt(3)*cos(x) - sqrt(3)*tan(x) +3` that is easy to solve when we do factor the eq correctly.But solveset is hanging for these types of equations. We first do factor of original eq (Trig eq.) then rewrite in into `exp` form for further steps.
 
* Goals for Shekhar:

  - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) improve the code for more testcases.

### Meeting #07
* Date: 10 June, 2016
* Time:  -  (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion :

  - Completed the implementation of the methods for finding the domain of a function
  - Few functions such as `1/tan(x)` and `1/log(x)` yield incorrect answers in the `Reals` domain.
For this Harsh suggested the use of `Extended Reals` as the `domain`. 
  - These functions need to be shifted to the `util` module from the `singularities`. 

* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Study extended reals and their applicability.
  - Complete [PR#11224](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11224).

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

  - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) simplified general solution: `reduce_imageset` function is for reducing number of Imageset. So shift it to `Union` (Imageset union) it is related to `Set`. Some testcases is failing because of Dummy `n`. Use one dummy.

   - PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : some testcase is failing because of negative comes inside log check it.
 
* Goals for Shekhar:

  - shift code for simplification of imageset into `Union` defined in `sets/sets.py`.

  - Edit testcases of nonlinsolve.

  - Integers solution using diophantine.


### Meeting #08
* Date: 19 June, 2016
* Time: 6:30 - 7:45 (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion :

  - `solveset(1/tan(x), x, Interval(0, 2*pi))` returns `EmptySet`.  
Expected answer: `{pi/2, 3*pi/2}`
This is due to the `check_domain` function which checks the continuity of `tan(x)` at `pi/2` and `3*pi/2`
Resolution : Try to replace `check_domain` with newly implemented `continuous_domain`.

  - Automatic Simplification of expressions such as `x/x` to `1`.
This leads to incorrect result for domains. 
For example, domain of `x/x` is `S.Reals - {0}`.
However, due to automatic simplification, we get `S.Reals` as the result.
   
* Goals for Kshitij:
  - Update [PR#11224](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11224) with the review suggestions.
  - Make a post on the mailing list regarding automatic simplification.

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

  - PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : Need more clear documentation for `substitution` function and comments as well.

  - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) simplified general solution: I shifted the code to `_union` (ImageSet union) and created new helper function `_union_simplify`.

  - PR [#11234](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234) solveset_integers to get solution in S.Integers Domain.

  - PR [#11257](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11257) There is problems in old solver already issues are opened for simple Trig inequalities one of them is [#9721](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/9721). Created a function `solveset_univariate_trig_inequality` to handle Trig ineq. Work in progress.
 
 
* Goals for Shekhar:

  - PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve - add more testcases and import all cases from old solve. Improve docstring.
  - PR [#11257](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11257) work continue improve the code.

### Meeting #09
* Date: 26 June, 2016
* Time: 10:00 PM - 11:15 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion :

  - In order to mitigate the effects of automatic simplification on `solveset` and the domain of After much discussion on singularities and domain, it was decided that removable singularities should be returned as part of the domain( in the result returned by `continuous_domain`). 

* Goals for Kshitij:
 - Update [PR#11277](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11277) for final review.
 - Look for ways to incorporate removable singularities in the domain.
 
* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

 - PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : Remove dependency (It was using old solvers`_invert` method, because it can accept list of symbols).

 - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) simplified general solution: This PR passes all the check but sometimes it fails if we run the `bin/test` locally. All the testcases works fine, there might be the problem of Dummy variables. Still finding the solution.  
 
 - PR [#11234](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234) `solveset_integers` : to get solution in S.Integers Domain.
We discussed on this [comment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10994#discussion_r61920649). Main point was `solveset` should return complete solution but we don't know exactly whether diophantine is returning all the soln or not. If there is some eq. type for which `diophantine` is not implemented or returns missing soln then `solveset_integers` should return `ConditionSet` for these cases.

  - Also discussed to improve communication skill and write proper comments.


* Goals for Shekhar:

  - Read docs and blogs for diophantine module and check for which diophantine eq type soln is incomplete.

  - Complete [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) (nonlinsolve) , PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) (simplified general solution).


### Meeting #10
* Date: 2 July, 2016
* Time: 10:00 PM - 11:15 PM (IST)
* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

* Kshitij's part of the discussion :

  -todo

* Goals for Kshitij:
 -todo

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

 - PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : discussed about breaking code into functions to make it more modular and returning `conditionset` when nonlinsolve not able to solve system.

 - PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) simplified general solution: The issue(sometimes pass the testcases, sometimes fails) is fixed now. I think by using [FiniteSet](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188/files#diff-7b3e9b0852f1b1d094f87233f56e201fR1205) it will arrange `args` in same order always that fixes the issue.
 
 - PR [#11334](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334) `solveset_integers` : to get solution in S.Integers Domain.
I observed [this](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334#issuecomment-230212018) in diophantine.So it seems we need to permute sign only when eq type is `general_sum_of_even_powers`, `homogeneous_ternary_quadratic`, `pythagorean` and updated the PR.


* Goals for Shekhar:

  - read diophantine module and get soln for this [comment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334#issuecomment-230105851).

  - Complete [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) (nonlinsolve) , PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188) (simplified general solution).

* Goals for Kshitij:
 -todo

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

 -  PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : Discussed about how to improve code quality and D.R.Y (Don't repeat yourself), loose coupling concepts in programming.

 - [#11343](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11343) : No need of defining new attribute `put_values` im imageset.

```
In [3]: img = ImageSet(Lambda((n, m), n**2 + m) , S.Reals)

In [4]: img.put_values({n: 1, m: 2})
Out[4]: {3}
```

One should first check that if value (to be substituted) is in `base_set` of not, if yes then using `imageset.lamda(values_for_lambda_var) ` user can get the value. Edit the PR and in the docstring write about how to substitute a value in lambda variables.


* Goals for Shekhar:

  - Improve PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve, PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188), PR [#11234](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234) `solveset_integers` .
 
  - [#11343](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11343)  edit this PR.

* Shekhar's part of the discussion : 

 - Discussed about our deadlines for coding period and previous PR related queries.

 -  PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve : Helper functions was not defined correctly, still need improvement in code quality.

 - We need some kind of eliminate function, like http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Eliminate.html. See also http://stackoverflow.com/q/20826969/161801 , I am trying to use subs and _invert to get answer. May be one can use replace, xreplace, match to eliminate some kind of same sub expression.

* Goals for Shekhar:

  - Improve PR [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) nonlinsolve, PR [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188), PR [#11234](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234) `solveset_integers` .

* Attendees: Amit Kumar, Harsh Gupta, Kshitij Saraogi, Shekhar Prasad Rajak

###### Minutes of Meeting:

With the endterm evaluation deadline fast approaching, the motive of the meeting was to discuss our goals for the next couple of weeks. This will help us have a clearly identify the tasks we need to complete so as to achieve a passing grade.

* **Endterm evaluation goals**

  - For Kshitij

  1. Discussion on [PR#11458](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11458). Getting this merged during the SoC should be a top priority.

  2. Work on `transolve`: transcendental equation solver
  It is expected of me to complete the `transolve` and open a WIP (atleast) during the next 2 weeks.
  However, it might not get merged during the official SoC period. If so, it will be my responsibility to see it through even after the SoC is over.


###### For Shekhar : 

_Goal for next week_ : 

* Complete nonlinsolve [#11111](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111) , Simplified solution for trigonometric equations [#11188](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188), Solveset Integers for integer solution :[#11234](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234)

* Check coverage_report and improve it.

_Works I mentioned in project_ :

* Improved Trigonometric Equation Solver , Simplified general form for trigonometric solution
* Nonlinear Multivariate System of Equations
* Transcendental (Kshitij is working on it)
* Integer solution of a linear equation
* Inequalities and Equation solver having functions (Kshitij is working on it)

_Work Completed_ :

* Improved Rewrite for trigonometric functions (https://github.com/sympy/ sympy/pull/11424)
* Some bug fixes: https://github.com/sympy/ sympy/pull/11409 https://github.com/sympy/      sympy/pull/11343https://github.com/sympy/ sympy/pull/11339 https://github.com/sympy/ sympy/pull/11280 https://github.com/sympy/ sympy/pull/11201

_Work in Progress_ :

* nonlinsolve https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111
* Simplified solution for trigonometric equations https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188
* Solveset Integers for integer solution : https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234 , https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334

_TODO_ :

* After the PR https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188, we can fix more bugs(Using PR https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10733) of Trig solver.
 Most of the time solveset don't use inverse trig functions . e.g.

                In [6]: solveset(sin(x)+cos(y),x)
                Out[6]: {x | x ∊ ℝ ∧ sin(x) + cos(y) = 0}
                # ans is asin(cos(y)) + n*π, 2*n*pi - asin(cos(y))

also need to add inverse trig formula/identities in `simplify`  

* define helper function for `_solve_trig` which will be called when it find the trig equation of the type `sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x)` (we first rewrite of the form `sincos` then using `match` we can find equation of the type `p*sin(x) + q*cos(x)` then this helper function will be called. So it will make it `sin(x + y)` (dividing `sqrt(p**2 + q**2)` then get the trig identity form). Using `solve_decompogen` we can solve `sin(x + y)` similarly we can use more trig identities.

* I worked on  https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/2720 ( define eliminate()), (after the main project this will be discussed).

_Few more points_ :

* nonlinsolve https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11111 : We have discussed about this PR many times. It is almost done, but there is need of improvement in code quality. it became little messy because `substitution` function  is handling all kind of solution type(ImageSet, FiniteSet, ConditionSet, Intersection, Complement).

* I hope https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11188 and https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11234 , https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11334 will be merged soon.

* I have written blog post for each week. Details regarding my works, issues I faced, ideas, todo part (and works that can be done in future) are in the posts. blog link : http://shekharrajak.github.io/
