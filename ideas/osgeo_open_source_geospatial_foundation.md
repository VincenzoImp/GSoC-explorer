## OSGeo Google Summer of Code 2026

The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](http://www.osgeo.org) would like to extend a welcome to the interested SoC contributors. On this page, you will find links to a host of ideas organized by project. You will find ideas ranging from the depths of computer science graph theory to the heights of visualization. One thing all these ideas have in common is lots and lots of spatial data.

These ideas are ***only*** to motivate you and serve as an example of the kind of hills we want to charge up. Your own ideas are more than welcome - they are encouraged. We view you as the next wave of open-source leaders and the future of the geospatial industry; show us what you've got!

**Contributors: check out the**[Google Summer of Code Recommendations for Students](/ideas/osgeo-open-source-geospatial-foundation/google_summer_of_code_recommendations_for_students)page.- If you need more information on how to apply you can contact us on
[OSGeo's discourse](https://discourse.osgeo.org/c/initiatives/soc) - Read the
[GSoC Roles and Responsibilities](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/responsibilities)to understand successful teamwork and interplay of project, mentors, and students.

- There is a
[Google SoC flyer](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/resources/flyers)to look at and post in appropriate places.

[OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org)is involved in working with maps and things, but what kind of projects does it really do? Have a look at the[live blog feed](http://planet.osgeo.org/)to see what people are working on right now.

- Mentors, there's an additional link providing some tips and specifying your responsibilities on the main OSGeo
[Google Summer of Code Administrative](/ideas/osgeo-open-source-geospatial-foundation/google_summer_of_code_administrative)wiki page.

## Recent Modifications in GSoC (Must Read)

- The program is open to all the students who are 18 years and older AND to the beginners in open source development, who might not be university students but are 18 years and older. With folks around the world changing careers, returning to the workforce, and learning on their own (outside of academic programs) we see an opportunity to reach a plethora of excited individuals who want to learn more about open source and be a part of our amazing GSoC communities. Check
[Eligibility](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/)here.

- GSoC Contributors will be able to choose from multiple-size projects: medium at ~175 hours, large at ~350 hours and small at ~90 hours. This is to remove the barrier of available time that many potential contributors have and open the program to people who want to learn about open source development but can’t dedicate all or even half of their summer to the program.

- We are building increased flexibility around the timing of projects - there is an option to extend the standard 12-week coding time frame to a maximum of 22 weeks. This is to allow folks who may realize that spreading the work over say, 16 weeks, is a more realistic goal with their current life situation. Or for contributors who have life happen in the middle of the program and they can’t work on their projects for a few weeks, but they can come back to it after a month to finish it. This would make it easier for GSoC Contributors and mentors to be able to navigate together when obstacles occur and the GSoC Contributor can successfully complete their project.
